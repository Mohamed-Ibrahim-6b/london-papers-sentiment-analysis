0,"Over 100 students at Columbia were arrested last week after refusing to leave a pro-Palestine protest encampment set up on the university’s main campus. The arrests have since set off a chain of events, including the re-establishing of the encampment and solidarity protests on other US college campuses.

On Monday, Columbia announced it will hold classes virtually to try to “reset” the situation on campus. Here’s what we know so far about what’s happening at Columbia.

 An encampment for divestment
Students started setting up a protest encampment in the center of Columbia’s campus at about 4am on Wednesday last week, building tents on the campus lawn in upper Manhattan. The student protesters said they would occupy the lawn until the university divests from companies with ties to Israel.

The encampment was timed with the upcoming congressional testimony of Columbia president Minouche Shafik that was taking place that day on the university’s response to antisemitism.

On Wednesday night, the university began warning protesters that those still occupying the lawn would be subject to arrest. In the early afternoon on Thursday, the NYPD arrested 108 students who were in the encampments.

Many of the students who were arrested have been temporarily suspended by the university, including Isra Hirsi , a student at Barnard, which is affiliated with Columbia. Hirsi is the daughter of the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

During a news conference later that day, NYPD commissioner Edward Caban said: “The students that were arrested were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever, and were saying what they wanted to say.”

In a campus-wide email, Shafik said she requested NYPD clear the encampment as it “severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students”.

The crackdown was condemned by a group of professors who said they were “shocked at [Shafik’s] failure to mount any defense of the free inquiry central to the educational mission of a university in a democratic society and at her willingness to appease legislators seeking to interfere with university affairs”.

 Columbia president’s congressional hearing
The day before the arrests, Shafik testified in front of the House on Columbia’s response to antisemitism on Wednesday, a highly charged hearing that was fraught with clashes among Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

Rightwing lawmakers and activists have long painted college campuses, especially at elite universities, as hotbeds for troublesome liberal activists. Though the hearings are purportedly centered around antisemitism, much of the scrutiny from Republicans have been focused on the colleges’ reaction to pro-Palestinian student protesters. The former presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania ultimately resigned after they participated in similar hearings on antisemitism last fall.

During her hearing, Shafik said that Columbia has been under “an extreme pressure test” over the last six months.

“Our systems clearly have not been equipped to manage the unfolding situation,” she said. Shafik said the university, at that point, had suspended 15 students associated with protests and had asked the NYPD, for the first time in 50 years, to assist.

 Solidarity protests begin, while White House rebukes antisemitism
Though police had cleared out the protest encampment after the students were arrested, a new encampment on a different lawn was constructed. The encampment remained active through the weekend and on Monday, though the university closed the campus’s gates to the public.

Starting on Friday, students at campuses across the country held walkouts in solidarity with the Columbia students who were arrested. Students at Brown, Princeton and Northwestern held protests on Friday and over the weekend. Meanwhile, students at Yale and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill started their own encampments.

Meanwhile, protests outside Columbia’s campus began over the weekend, which included clashes among pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian activists. By this point, the university had closed its campus gates to the public, making it unclear whether the protesters were affiliated with the university.

At one point, reports of people shouting antisemitic statements like “go back to Poland” were posted on social media. Columbia Chabad, a chapter of the international Orthodox Jewish movement, wrote a statement saying that Jewish students were shouted at on their way to the dorms.

“We are horrified and worried about physical safety,” the group wrote.

In a statement on social media, Columbia’s Apartheid Divest, one of the group’s coordinating the encampment, said that the incidents were not associated with the student protests and that their “priority is the safety of all”, including “not antagonizing counter-protesters or escalating situations unnecessarily”.

In a statement celebrating Passover, Joe Biden released a White House statement addressing the reports, though he did not name Columbia specifically.

“Even in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,” the statement read.

 Columbia holds classes virtually on Monday, while Yale protesters are arrested
On Monday, as the encampment still continued and the university’s gates remained closed to the public, Shafik announced the university will be holding classes virtually on Monday.

“The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. Those tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas,” Shafik said. “We need a reset.”

In New Haven, Connecticut, at least 47 people were arrested at Yale on Monday morning after setting up an encampment on campus Friday night.

“The university made the decision to arrest those individuals who would not leave the plaza with the safety and security of the entire Yale community in mind and to allow access to university facilities by all members of our community,” said a statement from the university.

 A sensitive time on college campuses
The protests at Columbia and other colleges take place at a sensitive time on campuses, which have seen widespread protests, largely calling for ceasefire and divestment, over the last few months.

Recently, university leaders have used harsher measures to clamp down on student protests. In December, Brown arrested 41 students who held a sit-in in a school building. The students were ultimately charged with trespassing.

Earlier this month, Vanderbilt expelled three students out of a group of 27, all who were suspended, who participated in a sit-in protest on campus. A group of 20 students at Pomona College in California were suspended after staging a protest at the office of the university president.

Last week, the University of Southern California faced intense backlash after it canceled the valedictorian speech of a Muslim student because of the “alarming tenor” of reactions to her selection and the “substantial risks relating to security”.

 This article was amended on 23 April 2024. The USC cancelled the valedictorian speech of a Muslim student because of reactions to her selection, not to her speech as stated in an earlier version.","Israel , Gaza and divestment: why are Columbia students protesting?",The Guardian (London),"April 22, 2024 Monday 9:14 PM GMT",0.463019,0.50841117,0.028569836,palestine_guardian1
1,"Israel has made it through to the final of the Eurovision song contest, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged event in Malmö on Saturday.

At Thursday’s second semi-final in Sweden’s third largest city, viewers from the competing countries backed the Israeli singer Eden Golan as one of the 10 entries to progress.

Earlier in the day a demonstration in Malmö’s city centre saw thousands protest against the decision to include Israel while its military campaign in Gaza continues. Further protests, and an alternative concert billed by organisers as a “a song contest without genocide”, are planned for Saturday.

Twenty-six of the 37 entrants will compete in Saturday’s final. After Loreen’s triumph last year, the host and record winner Sweden was guaranteed a place alongside the “big five” of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, which make the biggest financial contributions. The remaining 20 qualified via the semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday.

Israel was allowed to compete this year after it agreed to modify the lyrics of its entry , a ballad widely understood to be a reference the Hamas massacre on 7 October.

The original version of Hurricane, which was titled October Rain, was barred by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaking rules on political neutrality.

Eurovision’s 68th edition takes place seven months into Israel’s bombardment campaign on the Gaza Strip, and just days after the Israel Defense Forces launched a major military offensive in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city.

Golan, 20, who was born in Israel to Russian parents, was booed by members of the audience during dress rehearsals on Wednesday. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, later released a statement in which he praised the singer for “successfully facing a wave of antisemitism while standing and representing the state of Israel with respect”.

Earlier on Thursday, between 5,000 and 6,000 protesters had marched through Malmö city centre to protest against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the country’s inclusion in the event, according to police.

A rally in support of Israel’s inclusion in the contest, held in Malmö’s Hästhagen neighbourhood, drew about 120 people, police in attendance said.

Among the crowd of protesters waving Palestinian flags on Malmö’s town square was Greta Thunberg. “It is outrageous that Israel is allowed to participate”, said the environmental activist, wearing a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh over her shoulders. “We cannot remain silent during a genocide.”

Pro-Palestinian protesters have accused the EBU of double standards. It disqualified Russia from Eurovision in 2022, saying the country’s inclusion would “bring the competition into disrepute”.

The EBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete, saying Eurovision is “a non-political music event” and “not a contest between governments.”

Palestinian flags have been banned inside the venue, but at Tuesday’s semi-final one performer wore a keffiyeh around his wrist.

Eric Saade, whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon, wore the garment while performing his 2011 Eurovision entry Popular. The EBU later said he had compromised “the non-political nature of the event”.

“The EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial,” Saade said in a post on Instagram. “It says nothing about me, but everything about them.”

2,"A spectre is haunting Westminster – the spectre of collective violence against MPs. Large crowds chant noisily outside parliament during debates on Palestine; protesters surround Tobias Ellwood’s house; Jo Stevens’ constituency office is vandalised – and all this against the backdrop of the murders of David Amess and Jo Cox. The parties are united in seeking to exorcise this spectre. It has already led to parliamentary procedure being changed in a way that made a mockery of the debate over violence in Gaza. It has also led to calls for new police powers to curb protests outside parliament. But is collective violence the problem here, and is the introduction of yet more curbs on protest the answer?

Certainly, acts of vandalism and of violence against MPs cast a chill over our democracy and have no justification. But over the past months, a few individual acts have become conflated with the collective protests – and in turn, protest has been equated with violence, or the threat of it.

All this is exemplified by the language of “the mob”. The prime minister has decried “aggressive mobs” as the root of the problem. He is echoed by the home secretary and by the government’s adviser on political violence, John Woodcock , who slams the “aggressive intimidation of MPs” by “mobs”. Referring to crowds as mobs plays into a long tradition that presupposes it is in their nature to be volatile, destructive and violent.

Such negative views of crowds have been around since time immemorial. But they became systematised with industrialisation and the formation of a mass society during the 19th century. The elite feared that the urban masses would, in huge numbers, reject existing hierarchies. Moreover, if the masses were an imminent threat to the social order, the crowd was the mass in action – the sum of all fears.

As the challenge grew, so crowds came to be viewed in more and more negative terms. This was particularly true in France, rocked by defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, by the Paris Commune and by the rising tide of discontent against the Third Republic, which grew from its ashes. In the 1870s there was an average of 80 strikes a year. By the early 1890s that figure grew to more than 400 a year, peaking at 634 in 1893, just before the publication in 1895 of Gustave Le Bon’s book The Crowd – arguably the most influential psychology text ever written.

Le Bon’s account is a litany of loss. In crowds people lose their identity, they lose their rationality, they lose their morality. People “descend several rungs on the ladder of civilisation” on entering the crowd. They become “only powerful for destruction”. Even the most reasonable people lose control of themselves and become bestial in the mass. In a phrase, all crowds are mad, bad and dangerous to know.

There is just one problem with all this. While some crowds clearly can be violent, crowd violence is actually extremely rare. Of the some 2,700 strikes in the period when Le Bon was writing, only 3.6% led to violent acts. In only one – the Decazeville strike of 1886 – was anyone killed. And yet Decazeville haunted Le Bon and his fellow crowd psychologists of the time. For them it was emblematic of all crowds. The exception became the rule.

The same is true today. In recent years, the US has been obsessed by Black Lives Matter protests. It is estimated that between 15 and 26 million people participated in demonstrations in the weeks after George Floyd’s death. There has been much controversy over these events, with many claims of violence and intimidation. But careful analysis by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project showed 93% of events to be peaceful.

In this country, we have generally been more obsessed by the violence of sporting crowds – particularly football hooliganism, the so-called “English disease”. It wasn’t just big in the 1970s and 80s. It might seem that it hasn’t gone away. A couple of years back, the headlines screamed that “football-related arrests rocket amid rise in violent disorder”. But looking more closely at this nightmare image of football crowds, there were 2,198 arrests at football grounds in the 2021-22 season, of which 20% were for violent disorder (a little over 400). In 2022-23 the figures were much the same. There were 2,264 arrests, of which 21% were for violent disorder – and this out of a total of 45 million attendances at games. In other words, there was a one in 100,000 chance of someone attending a game being arrested for being violent – hardly compatible with the idea that crowds are “mobs” in which people are inherently violent.

There is one further twist to this tale. Even where crowd events are violent, the great majority of the violence tends to be inflicted by the authorities, not by crowd members. In England, during the 18th and 19th centuries, more than 600 people died in popular disturbances – all but a handful killed by the yeomanry, cavalry or other such forces. During the US urban riots of the 1960s, the vast majority of those who died were shot by state or federal forces: 14 of the 17 who died in the 1967 Newark riot were shot by officials, while in Detroit in the same year, the figure was 19 out of 29.

Overall, then, the language (and the idea) of the mob paints a false picture of crowds, of crowd violence and of violence in society more generally. The gathering of people in protest does not indicate the imminent outbreak of violence and excess. It cannot, in and of itself, be taken as evidence of intimidation. It is not a threat to our democracy.

On the contrary, crowds and protests are an essential dimension of our democracy. The mark of a healthy society is when everyone feels safe to participate in protest. The more you instil fear of the crowd and the more you place curbs on crowds, the more you narrow participation to those who are prepared to countenance conflict. Moreover, it is precisely when people consider that the authorities are illegitimately blocking their democratic rights to peaceful protest that they are willing to act violently.

The message is clear. You will understand and deal with crowds far better if, as enshrined in international human rights law, you start from the presumption that they are peaceful rather than violent. It is by ignoring this message that our MPs make themselves less safe. Should they seek to make collective protest more difficult, it will increase rather than decrease the dangers they face, and undermine rather than safeguard our democracy. It is high time that we lay the spectre of the “mob” to rest.

3,"Plans to stop UK public bodies boycotting foreign countries and British companies that trade with them represent a further attack on the right to freedom of expression, civil society groups have said.

Officials from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) have said the boycotts, divestment and sanctions bill, announced in last year’s Queen’s speech and designed to stop actions against Israel, will be tabled soon.

The move, first reported by the FT , comes amid anger over the crackdown against protesters at last week’s coronation of King Charles, days after the Public Order Act was given royal assent.
The bill would outlaw campaigns, including those relating to the purchase of goods and services or investments. The government has previously highlighted a 2014 Leicester city council motion banning goods from illegal Israeli settlements, while the communities secretary, Michael Gove, has claimed the Israel-targeting BDS (boycotts, divestment and sanctions) movement is fuelling antisemitism.
However, 60 civil society groups under the right to boycott umbrella claim the bill will stifle social and climate justice campaigns.

Ben Jamal, the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign UK, said it was “yet another example of this government attacking democratic participation”.

He said: “With support growing around the world for the call issued by Palestinian civil society for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, the British government seems determined to shield Israel, and companies involved in its occupation, from accountability for its violations of human rights and international law.

“This bill will weaken campaigns against deforestation, environmental pollution, and the exploitation of children and workers. That is why such a wide range of groups have come together, from trade unions, charities and NGOs, to faith, climate justice, human rights, cultural, campaigning, and solidarity organisations. How can we rely on ministers to uphold ethical standards around the world while they chip away our democratic rights at home?”

In February, despite opposing the BDS movement, the Union of Jewish students passed a motion opposing the bill , saying it would curtail “the democratic right to non-violently protest”.

Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at Liberty, said: “For a government that professes to care about free speech, the proposed anti-boycott bill, once again, shows their flimsy commitment to protecting freedom of expression.

“This bill must be seen in the context of wider government attempts to curb our rights to protest and for people to stand up for what they believe in. This bill sets an extremely dangerous precedent, and its potential impact is harmful and wide-ranging. We urge the government to rethink its plans.”

The bill’s opponents say boycotts, divestment and sanctions have been used to confront injustice historically, including the transatlantic slave trade and apartheid South Africa.
Unison said it could “silence any attempt to shame China’s terrible treatment of the Uyghurs”.

Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said fossil fuel divestment had led to institutions with a combined value of more than $40tn (£32tn) diverting their money away from polluting industries. “Banning public bodies from using these vital tactics unless they support UK foreign policy would be a frightening and authoritarian step,” he said.

A DLUHC spokesperson said it would legislate “as soon as parliamentary time allows”, adding: “We are firmly opposed to local boycotts which can damage integration and community cohesion, hinder exports, and harm our economic security.”","UK anti-boycott bill is attack on freedom of expression, say civil society groups",The Guardian (London),"May 12, 2023 Friday 12:48 PM GMT",0.6115301,0.36514908,0.023320785,palestine_guardian1
4,"University campuses around the world have been the stage of a growing number of protests by students demanding academic institutions divest from companies supplying arms to Israel.

The protests, which first spread across college campuses in the US, have reached universities in the UK, the rest of Europe, as well as Lebanon and India.

The students say they are voicing their opposition to, what they describe as, their university’s “complicity” in Israel’s assault on Gaza that has killed more than 34,700 people. Israel said its military offensive was a response to the attack by Hamas militants on 7 October, when about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.

More than 2,500 demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far, with protests on college campuses attracting global media attention and reaction from Palestinians trapped in the besieged Gaza.

More protests are expected, with the Israeli assault on Rafah drawing international condemnation. Some students have begun hunger strikes in protest against their university’s “silence and inaction”.

 Where are the protests happening?
Demonstrations have been staged at nearly 140 college campuses in the US, spanning 45 states and Washington DC since protests began at Columbia University in New York. 

Dramatic scenes unfolded at Columbia about a week ago when more than 100 students were arrested after police officers entered the campus. 

The university called on the police to tackle demonstrators who had occupied Hamilton Hall, renaming it Hind’s Hall, after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza. 

Afterwards, Joe Biden, rejected claims that the protests were non-violent. “Destroying property is not a peaceful protest; it’s against the law,” the US president said.

Biden added: “There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans.”

Since then, students at about 14 UK universities have also set up encampments.

Hala Hanina, a Palestinian student who has been involved in protests at the Newcastle University, said: “It’s so important for the student community and British community that they are fighting for justice.”

More than a dozen students at Princetonand 10 students at Edinburgh have said they will begin a hunger strike in protest at their university’s policies.

Prof Peter Mathieson, the principal and vice-chancellor at Edinburgh, said: “We have very recently been notified of the intention of an unknown number of students to commence a hunger strike as an indication of their strength of feeling and determination around issues related to Palestine and Israel.

“While we recognise their bodily autonomy, we appeal to them and others not to take risks with their own health, safety and wellbeing. We are in daily contact with the protesters to ensure they are aware of the health and wellbeing support available to them.”

 What is the situation in mainland Europe?
Small protests have taken place at universities including in France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, although most were swiftly cleared by police.

The largest was at the University of Amsterdam where riot police, acting at the request of university authorities, city hall and public prosecutors, moved in early on Tuesday morning to break up an encampment that had sprung up on Monday.

Police used a mechanical digger to break down barricades of pallets and bicycles erected by the protesters and used batons to disperse the crowd – 125 of whom refused to leaveand were arrested. Most were released after a few hours.

The university said: “We share the anger and bewilderment over the war, and we understand that there are protests over it. We stress that within the university, dialogue about it is the only answer.”

 What are the student protesters calling for?
Many want universities to sell off shares, assets or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment.

Activists say universities and colleges investing in Israeli companies or organisations doing business in Israel are “complicit” in the war in Gaza. 

The protesters are also calling for a ceasefire, for universities to acknowledge the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory as a “genocide” and to “condemn the destruction of all of Gaza’s universities”.

Some students have also fused their demands on Gaza with their calls for universities to help tackle the climate crisis.

More than 100 students occupied Ghent University in Belgium calling for concrete action to meet the institution’s 2030 climate plans, as well as demanding it cuts ties with companies connected to the Israeli military.

The university did not respond to a request for comment but its director, Rick Van de Walle, posted a statement saying its ethical policies would not change, adding: “No deviation from the existing human rights policy will be used with regard to one particular country, in this case Israel.”
 How have universities responded?
There has been a varied response from academic institutions to student protests, ranging from dramatic crackdowns to negotiations. 

Brown University in Rhode Island brokered an agreement with students last week that the institution’s highest governing body, the Corporation, would vote on divestment from companies affiliated with Israel during a meeting in October. In return, students cleared the encampments.

Northwestern University in Illinois and the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, have also reached agreements with students, while Columbia has called off its main graduation ceremony.  

An occupation at Goldsmiths in London also came to an end after the university agreed to the students’ demands, including the renaming of a lecture hall after the Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, humanitarian scholarships for Palestinian students and a review of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism.",Why have student protests against Israel ’s war in Gaza gone global?,The Guardian (London),"May 8, 2024 Wednesday 12:14 PM GMT",0.640924,0.33671293,0.022363117,palestine_guardian1
5,"Nine people have been arrested after a banner with a pro-Palestinian slogan was displayed on a building in central London.

The banner, which read “globalise the intifada”, was hung outside a building in Park Square, near Regent’s Park, on Tuesday.

The Metropolitan police said the building, a large Georgian terrace in one of the most expensive parts of London, was being used by squatters but had now been secured.

The Arabic word “intifada” means shaking off or struggle and is often used to describe periods of uprising, some of them involving the use of terrorism, by Palestinians in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Police said the arrests had been carried out under section 18 of the Public Order Act, which prohibits the display of “any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting” if the intention or likely consequence is to stir up racial hatred.

They said the banner had been removed and they would maintain a presence in the area to respond to “any further incidents”. Officers had left the scene by 4.30pm, the PA news agency reported.

When asked on 30 October about language used at some pro-Palestinian protests, an official spokesperson for the prime minister said calling for intifada was “obviously … not acceptable”.

Referring to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, the spokesperson added: “People need to think extremely carefully about the impact of their actions following a traumatic terror event which saw more than 1,000 people killed.”

The pro-Palestinian protests of recent weeks have brought renewed debate about freedom of speech and whether certain slogans constitute calls for violence or even genocide.

Among the most controversial has been a chant, frequently heard at the demonstrations, that states: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”

Activists have argued that the phrase is only a call for freedom and human rights for Palestinians, but in a letter to senior police officers in October Suella Braverman, then the home secretary, said it could be understood as an “expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world”.

She said that in certain contexts using the slogan could amount to a racially aggravated public order offence.",Nine arrested over pro- Palestinian banner in London,The Guardian (London),"December 5, 2023 Tuesday 8:12 PM GMT",0.64207244,0.34020516,0.017722407,palestine_guardian1
6,"Students demonstrating in solidarity with Gaza waved Palestinian flags and keffiyehs and chanted anti-war slogans during the University of Michigan’s commencement ceremony on Saturday.

Videos on social media showed students donning their graduation gowns as they appeared to chant : “Israel bombs, UMich pays!” and “How many kids have you killed today?” One photo showed a plane appearing to carry a sky banner over the university with the message: “Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!”

According to the Associated Press, one banner read: “No universities left in Gaza.”

At one point, several graduates appeared to stage a walkout from the ceremony while carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs as onlooking students applauded.

The protest, along with numerous other student-led protests across US universities, comes amid Israel’s deadly war on Gaza since Hamas’s 7 October attacks that killed more than 1,100 Israelis. In response, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians across Gaza while leaving 2 million survivors displaced across the narrow strip amid a famine caused by Israeli restrictions on aid.

Israel has also destroyed every university in Gaza, in addition to killing at least 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors, according to the UN, which has condemned Israel’s actions as “scholasticide”.

No arrests were reported during the University of Michigan ceremony, which comprised tens of thousands of attendees, the Associated Press reports, adding that as US navy secretary Carlos Del Toro addressed the crowd, he at one point said: “Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium.”

While administering an oath to the armed forces graduates, Del Toro said they would “protect the freedoms that we so cherish”, including “the right to protest peacefully”, according to the Associated Press.

On Monday, University of Michigan students set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment on campus in calls for the university to divest from companies with investments in Israel. The encampment was led by Tahrir, a coalition of more than 80 organizations including the university chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the Michigan Daily reports.

Pictures online showed various hand-painted signs at the encampment including ones that read : “Faculty and staff for liberation” and “Apartheid isn’t kosher! Jews demand divestment!”

On Friday, police arrested a pro-Palestinian protester outside the University of Michigan’s Museum of Art, the Detroit News reports , adding that police used a chemical spray to disperse students. According to a university spokesperson who spoke to the outlet, a dinner was held at the museum on Friday to recognize those receiving honorary degrees from the university.

One video online appeared to show Sarah Hubbard, chair of the university’s board of regents, waving and appearing to film students from inside the museum as they chanted: “Regent Hubbard, you can’t hide, you are funding genocide!”

In recent weeks, more than 2,000 people have been arrested during Palestinian solidarity and anti-war protests on US college campuses. University leaders have been heavily criticized across the country for authorizing police forces to conduct arrests on campus, many of which have been carried out violently.

At the University of Virginia, 25 people were arrested on Saturday for trespassing after police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters who refused to remove tents from campus.

At Columbia University in New York, the Columbia Spectator reported police using stun grenades on the anti-war protesters while carrying out arrests. The Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed that a police officer fired a gun during the arrests.

At the University of California, Los Angeles, videos online showed police in riot gear firing rubber bullets on campus, with anti-war student protesters saying that multiple people had been shot in the head.

Other videos surfacing online throughout the week showed multiple faculty members at various universities being violently arrested by police. In a post on X, Steve Tamari, a 65-year-old Middle East historian at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, said that he had been “body-slammed and crushed by the weight of several St Louis county police officers, then dragged across campus by the police”. In addition to broken ribs, Tamari said he sustained a broken hand.",Student protesters interrupt University of Michigan commencement,The Guardian (London),"May 4, 2024 Saturday 9:43 PM GMT",0.68309015,0.29775986,0.019149996,palestine_guardian1
7,"As demonstrations over the war in Gaza have surged on campuses, around cities and in offices across the US in recent weeks, a visible tension has emerged between the desire for public protest and a fear of professional reprisals.

On the Columbia University campus, where the latest spike in protests began on 17 April, demonstrators have worn masks and used blankets to block counter-protesters from filming students. Protesters at a tent encampment at the University of Michigan handed out masks upon entry, and students there refused to give reporters their full names in case the school took punitive action against them. At Harvard, the Palestine Solidarity Committee told the Guardian it had suspended doing press interviews out of regard for student safety.

Concerns over retaliation and harassment have permeated the protests, as an intense and organized effort to bring down personal and professional repercussions on demonstrators has played out online. Counter-protesters and pro-Israel activist groups have attempted to post demonstrators’ faces and personal information to intimidate them, an act known as doxing, and demanded that pro-Palestinian protesters remove their masks at rallies. The professional threat is not theoretical: employers have terminated workers over their comments about the Israel-Gaza war , and CEOs have demanded universities name protesters so as to blacklist them.

The result is that the public face of a nationwide student movement is often a covered one. Photos and videos from demonstrations show swaths of students either wearing keffiyehs – headdresses that have become a symbol of Palestinian solidarity – or medical masks that obscure their identity. During Yale’s protests , a 21-person choir sang This Little Light of Mine with masks over their faces.

Administrators have admonished students against wearing masks, in at least one case citing anti-mask laws from the 1950s originally intended to deter the Ku Klux Klan from holding rallies. At the University of North Carolina, the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine said that it was alarmed to receive an email from a university official citing campus policy and state law against wearing masks. The university did not dispute the email, telling the Guardian that an administrator was reminding an organization with a history of wearing face coverings about the policy.

At the University of Austin, Texas, the dean of students sent a letter canceling a campus demonstration and said that an organizer’s Instagram post telling protesters to bring masks would be a violation of school policy against obstructing law enforcement. The protest took place anyway, leading to state and local police arresting dozens of people for trespassing, including a local Fox journalist who was photographing the event. Pro-Israel activists have similarly called for demonstrators to take off their masks during heated counter-protests, while head of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, recently called for some coverings to be outlawed entirely.

“Masks that cover the entire face have no bearing on Covid or free speech and should be banned on all college campuses effective immediately,” Greenblatt tweeted.

While protesters are covering their faces to prevent harassment and retaliation, they also cited Covid concerns as an additional reason to mask up while attending mass gatherings. The ubiquity of masks, according to one organizer, was representative of a general concern for everyone demonstrating and the potential harm they face as a result.

“I don’t see it as coming top-down from organizations but more from within protest communities about how to keep each other safe,” said Liv Kunins-Berkowitz, a media coordinator for the activist group Jewish Voice For Peace. “That includes keeping yourself safe from surveillance and from having your photo posted all over the internet.”

 Doxings, firings and harassment
Since the start of the Israel-Gaza war in October last year, many pro-Palestinian demonstrators have had their personal information posted online and faced firings, suspensions and harassment. While some protesters have had their names, occupations and social media profiles posted after being filmed expressing blatantly antisemitic rhetoric or statements supporting Hamas, organized doxing efforts have also swept up people who have peacefully attended rallies, signed letters calling for a ceasefire or publicly criticized Israel.

As arrests at protests have surged and some lawmakers have called for sending in the national guard against demonstrators, the amount of surveillance at protests has also increased. The New York police department has deployed drones to monitor demonstrations, track movements and capture video footage, with the department saying it would use those recordings to help make arrests.

“At least in New York City, there’s a very big concern around police surveillance,” said one protester, who asked not to be named out of fear of personal and professional harm. They added that some organizers specifically told demonstrators to cover their faces and handed out masks at protests.

In the early weeks of protests against the war, the conservative group Accuracy In Media launched a campaign at Harvard that posted the names and faces of students who signed a pro-Palestinian open letter on the side of a billboard truck and branded them “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites”. It later expanded to other universities and created individualized websites branding students as antisemitic, leading to a lawsuit from one student and Columbia forming a Doxing Resource Group. Several other pro-Israel organizations, such as StopAntisemitism , have similarly dedicated websites and social media accounts to posting the personal information of protesters. People have described receiving death threats, harassment and being fired from their work after being featured in StopAntisemitism’s posts.

Another anonymously run site features hundreds of profiles of people who have been critical of Israel’s actions or taken part in protests, posting their social media profiles, occupations, home towns and photos of their faces. The site has specific lists for students and faculty, accusing them of antisemitism and supporting terrorism for signing open letters calling for ceasefire, affiliation with pro-Palestinian groups or being in attendance at anti-war rallies. These profiles now show up as top Google results when searching for the names of many of the people listed on the site, especially students with a smaller online presence.

Israeli authorities have also used information from that doxing website when making decisions to bar political activists from entering the country, Haaretz reported.
Concealing identity while protesting has a long history in the United States, and in recent decades has been a tactic commonly associated with anticapitalist activists at government summits or antifascists counter-protesting far-right rallies. Mask-wearing became enough of a hallmark of leftist protests that, in 2018, Republicans attempted to pass a vague anti-antifa bill that would have punished anyone protesting in a mask and acting in a threatening manner with up to 15 years in prison.

Several major events in recent years have additionally changed the way that people protest and their ability to remain anonymous. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic vastly changed the ubiquity of masks, as well as provided a loophole for many anti-mask policies and state laws around protesting with a concealed identity. The January 6 Capitol riots and subsequent search for perpetrators also highlighted how video footage and facial recognition technology can be used to easily identify people online. Self-appointed citizen investigators combed through videos for months after the attack, coordinating online to identify rioters and refer them to law enforcement officials.

 Protesters mask up in the office
The desire for anonymity has extended beyond college campuses to other pro-Palestinian demonstrations. When Google employees held a sit-in to protest against the company’s $1.2bn contract with the Israeli government and its military, many covered their faces out of fear of online harassment.

“Doxing is the main reason that people chose to conceal their identity in relation to this protest,” said a former Google worker who was fired for taking part in the demonstration.

Pro-Palestinian protesters at Google had been concerned for some time about other employees harassing them or leaking their personal information online, two former workers told the Guardian. Google fired more than 50 people over the course of several days for taking part in the protests against its Project Nimbus program.
Several fired workers continued to obscure their identities during a press conference in the days after the firing, out of worry that it would threaten future job prospects.

Google said in a statement that some fired employees “took longer to identify because their identity was partly concealed – like by wearing a mask without their badge – while engaged in the disruption.”",Why are pro- Palestinian US student protesters wearing masks on campus?,The Guardian (London),"April 30, 2024 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMT",0.52770007,0.45055088,0.021749062,palestine_guardian1
8,"Michigan is holding its presidential primaries on Tuesday, with campaigns by pro-Palestine activists to abandon Joe Biden and factional chaos in the state Republican party defining an otherwise sleepy election day.

There’s little drama in predicting the winners: Biden and Donald Trump are expected to romp in their respective races. But the dynamics of the contests hint at the deep divisions within the Democratic and Republican camps as the nationally unpopular candidates prepare to square off in a presidential general election rematch this fall.

Neither candidate is popular statewide. Only 17% of respondents in a January poll commissioned by the Detroit News said they believed Biden deserved a second term in office, while 33% said the same about Trump. When asked whether they would support Trump or Biden in the general, respondents favored Trump by 8 points.

Neither candidate faces much opposition in their respective primaries. Trump’s only serious foe is the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whom he just beat by a wide margin in her home-state primary on Saturday.

Biden’s greatest threat isn’t a candidate, but a movement: activists have launched a coordinated campaign to withhold votes from Biden to protest against his support for Israel’s war in Gaza. If they are successful, their efforts could embarrass him in the critical swing state – which has one of the largest Arab American communities in the country.

They are furious at Biden for his unwavering support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 people.

Eyeing this primary as an opportunity to pressure the president to revise his position on the war, a coalition of activists are calling on Democratic voters to select “uncommitted” on their ballot. The Listen to Michigan campaign, which activists launched in early February, has gained traction among some prominent political figures on the left, including the progressive former congressman Andy Levin and the US representative Rashida Tlaib, whose sister is spearheading the campaign.

“President Biden needs every vote he can get if he’s going to prevent Donald Trump and his white supremacist buddies from taking the White House again,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesperson for the Listen to Michigan campaign and the former chief of staff for the Missouri congresswoman Cori Bush. “Our votes on February 27 for ‘uncommitted’ hopefully will be a reminder of that.”

It’s not the first time Michigan Democrats have rallied around the “uncommitted” vote. In 2008, the Michigan Democratic party generated outrage by moving their primary to 15 January, shaking up the presidential primary order and prompting most candidates to drop out in protest. With Hillary Clinton as the only real contender on the ballot, a movement to vote “uncommitted” took hold. Nearly 40% of voters chose “uncommitted”, an embarrassment for Clinton and an early win for former president Barack Obama’s campaign.

In the 2012 Michigan Democratic primary, nearly 21,000 people voted “uncommitted” instead of for Obama – more than 10% of the total votes cast.

Alawieh argued that one metric for measuring the campaign’s success would be 10,000 people casting their votes as “uncommitted”, given that Trump won the state by roughly that margin in 2016.

“If we see that at least that many people vote for ‘uncommitted’, I think that sends a very, very strong message,” said Alawieh.

On the Republican side, a very different kind of split has driven the state party into feuding factions – making an already logistically complicated election even more confusing.

Trump is expected to beat Haley definitively in Tuesday’s primary. The primary margins and turnout will be telling, however – especially in traditionally Republican areas that have shifted away from the GOP during the Trump era, like parts of western Michigan and Detroit’s more upscale suburbs.

But the real chaos isn’t for the primary – it’s for the state convention that is scheduled a few days later. Or, to be more precise, the state party conventions: right now, two warring factions have scheduled their own meetings, and it’s not totally clear which meeting’s delegates will count towards the presidential nomination.

The Michigan Republican party is holding a separate caucus on 2 March to comply with Republican National Committee rules after Michigan’s Democrat-controlled state legislature moved the state’s primary date earlier than the RNC permitted. The winner of Tuesday’s primary will earn only 30% of the state’s delegates – party activists who vote at the Republican national convention to nominate the presidential candidate – while 70% will be chosen at a state party convention on Saturday.

Chaos within the state party has further complicated that plan.

In early January, a group of party activists held an election to oust the former Michigan GOP chairwoman, Kristina Karamo, accusing the fervent conspiracy theorist of mismanaging the state party’s finances. They later voted to replace her with Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and Trump’s former US ambassador to the Netherlands. On 14 February, the Republican National Committee declared their support for Hoekstra, recognizing him as the official state party chair.

Karamo has continued to claim she is the rightful chair of the party despite what the RNC says, and is forging ahead with her own plans for a party convention on Saturday near Detroit even as Hoekstra plans one in Grand Rapids, a few hours away.

“The political oligarchy within the Republican party has done everything possible to destroy me,” Karamo said in a podcast released just days after the RNC officially recognized Hoekstra’s leadership on 14 February.

Given the national party’s support for Hoekstra, it’s unlikely Karamo’s convention will carry any official weight. But the courts may have something to say about that.

On the same day voters head to the polls on Tuesday, the dueling factions will see each other in Kent county district court. Karamo’s opponents are asking a judge to determine whether she was properly removed from office, in hopes that a legal finding will push her to step down, allow them to seize control of the party’s finances and confirm that Hoekstra’s convention is the official one.

All that drama is overshadowing the primary.

“A good strong showing for Trump with a high turnout in key areas will bolster the Republican party if they can pull it off,” said Ken Kollman, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan. “But they’re riven by pretty deep splits right now.”

9,"Voters in Wisconsin cast their ballots today in an election that will test voter enthusiasm for Joe Biden and Donald Trump – and potentially enshrine two amendments in the state constitution affecting election administration across the state.

The president and former president are already the presumptive nominees and will almost certainly face off in the general election in November, and it seems that the threat of prosecution, general unpopularity and advanced age can’t stop them.

But while the primary will not offer alternative candidates, a group of activists in Wisconsin see it as an opportunity to push Biden on his policy toward Israel’s war on Gaza. The organizers, inspired by Michigan’s “uncommitted” campaign , which garnered more than 100,000 votes there, are calling on voters to choose “uninstructed” instead of Biden.

“The margins of our elections are so incredibly close – less than 1% in the last two presidential election cycles – so I think it would behoove the administration to pay attention,” said Reema Ahmad, the lead organizer of the Listen to Wisconsin campaign.

Organizers with the campaign aim to turn out as many voters for “uninstructed” as Biden’s margin of victory in 2020 to demonstrate their critical role in November, Ahmad said. The campaign has relied on the support of a broad network of progressive organizations, including the state’s largest network of Latino voters, Voces de la Frontera Action and Black Leaders Organizing Communities (Bloc), groups that helped propel Biden to his narrow 2020 victory.

Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York also hold presidential primaries today, and voters in Arkansas and Mississippi will participate in primary runoffs. Voters in Rhode Island and Connecticut will also have an “uncommitted” option on the ballot, and in New York, pro-Palestine activists are encouraging voters to leave their presidential primary options blank in protest.

The Trump campaign faces no similar challenge within the party, making Republican discontent with him harder to gauge. On 6 March, the former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, whose campaign gave anti-Trump Republicans a means to show their frustration with him, dropped out, and Trump snapped up enough delegates to secure the GOP nomination less than a week later. Haley and four other Republicans will still appear on the Wisconsin ballot alongside Trump.

Brandon Scholz, a retired Wisconsin GOP strategist, said primary turnout could lend some insight into how both candidates will fare in November. In 2020, Biden clawed back parts of the country that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 – especially in the suburbs, and especially suburban women. Biden also benefited from strong support from Black and Latino voters – groups that recent polls show could be slipping away from him .

“You want to do what you can to turn your base – your hardcore Dems and your hardcore Republicans, you want to be able to get them to the polls, because the last thing you want to do is come out looking like you didn’t do anything,” Scholz said.

Whether or not the Trump campaign will mobilize voters outside the Maga movement is another question.

“Observers will look to see what sort of participation traditional Republicans will have in this primary,” said Scholz. “And then finally, for both campaigns what are the ‘double haters’ going to do?”

Also on the ballot in Wisconsin are two constitutional amendments that voting rights and government watchdog groups warn could have a negative impact on elections administration in the state.

The first proposed amendment, which would ban elections offices from accepting private grant money to fund their operations, comes amid GOP anxieties – and election-denying conspiracy theories – about the role of funding from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s Center for Tech and Civic Life. During the 2020 election, the Facebook co-founder and his wife used funding from their organization to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in polling places and send voters information during the 2020 election.

The donations from Center for Tech and Civic Life became a key focus of Republicans, many of them activists who questioned the results of the 2020 election. “Zuckerbucks”, they argue, unfairly benefited Democratic strongholds – although there is no evidence that the grants, which reached small and large municipalities across the state, played a role in Biden’s victory.

The second proposed amendment would enshrine in the state constitution a provision that already exists in Wisconsin statute, mandating that “only election officials designated by law may perform tasks in the conduct of primaries, elections, and referendums”.

Both proposals were passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature, which sent them to voters after the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, vetoed them. And both, worries Debra Cronmiller, the executive director of Wisconsin’s League of Women Voters, could hurt voters.

“There’s no guarantee that the election will be funded fully in the absence of outside money,” said Cronmiller, of the proposal to ban elections offices from accessing private grants. Without sufficient funding – and the state legislature has not proposed additional resources to elections offices – she argued towns and counties are forced to hire fewer poll workers and host fewer polling locations, causing longer lines and a slower tally of the votes and disproportionately impacting poorer and smaller towns.

“They might not have the opportunities that a bigger municipality, that has deeper pockets, might have in order to serve their citizens,” she said.

The second proposed amendment, Cronmiller and other elections experts and voter advocates say, could prevent non-profits and other third-party groups from assisting voters in critical ways during elections. Groups that assist in driving voters to the polls, provide residents with information about voter registration, or help in the recruitment of poll workers, for example, could find themselves facing legal challenges for their work.

“We’re all scratching our heads and wondering: is this allowed? If this passes, and if we don’t do those things, how do voters get to the polls?” said Cronmiller.
