0,"Over 100 students at Columbia were arrested last week after refusing to leave a pro-Palestine protest encampment set up on the university’s main campus. The arrests have since set off a chain of events, including the re-establishing of the encampment and solidarity protests on other US college campuses.

On Monday, Columbia announced it will hold classes virtually to try to “reset” the situation on campus. Here’s what we know so far about what’s happening at Columbia.

 An encampment for divestment
Students started setting up a protest encampment in the center of Columbia’s campus at about 4am on Wednesday last week, building tents on the campus lawn in upper Manhattan. The student protesters said they would occupy the lawn until the university divests from companies with ties to Israel.

The encampment was timed with the upcoming congressional testimony of Columbia president Minouche Shafik that was taking place that day on the university’s response to antisemitism.

On Wednesday night, the university began warning protesters that those still occupying the lawn would be subject to arrest. In the early afternoon on Thursday, the NYPD arrested 108 students who were in the encampments.

Many of the students who were arrested have been temporarily suspended by the university, including Isra Hirsi , a student at Barnard, which is affiliated with Columbia. Hirsi is the daughter of the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

During a news conference later that day, NYPD commissioner Edward Caban said: “The students that were arrested were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever, and were saying what they wanted to say.”

In a campus-wide email, Shafik said she requested NYPD clear the encampment as it “severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students”.

The crackdown was condemned by a group of professors who said they were “shocked at [Shafik’s] failure to mount any defense of the free inquiry central to the educational mission of a university in a democratic society and at her willingness to appease legislators seeking to interfere with university affairs”.

 Columbia president’s congressional hearing
The day before the arrests, Shafik testified in front of the House on Columbia’s response to antisemitism on Wednesday, a highly charged hearing that was fraught with clashes among Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

Rightwing lawmakers and activists have long painted college campuses, especially at elite universities, as hotbeds for troublesome liberal activists. Though the hearings are purportedly centered around antisemitism, much of the scrutiny from Republicans have been focused on the colleges’ reaction to pro-Palestinian student protesters. The former presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania ultimately resigned after they participated in similar hearings on antisemitism last fall.

During her hearing, Shafik said that Columbia has been under “an extreme pressure test” over the last six months.

“Our systems clearly have not been equipped to manage the unfolding situation,” she said. Shafik said the university, at that point, had suspended 15 students associated with protests and had asked the NYPD, for the first time in 50 years, to assist.

 Solidarity protests begin, while White House rebukes antisemitism
Though police had cleared out the protest encampment after the students were arrested, a new encampment on a different lawn was constructed. The encampment remained active through the weekend and on Monday, though the university closed the campus’s gates to the public.

Starting on Friday, students at campuses across the country held walkouts in solidarity with the Columbia students who were arrested. Students at Brown, Princeton and Northwestern held protests on Friday and over the weekend. Meanwhile, students at Yale and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill started their own encampments.

Meanwhile, protests outside Columbia’s campus began over the weekend, which included clashes among pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian activists. By this point, the university had closed its campus gates to the public, making it unclear whether the protesters were affiliated with the university.

At one point, reports of people shouting antisemitic statements like “go back to Poland” were posted on social media. Columbia Chabad, a chapter of the international Orthodox Jewish movement, wrote a statement saying that Jewish students were shouted at on their way to the dorms.

“We are horrified and worried about physical safety,” the group wrote.

In a statement on social media, Columbia’s Apartheid Divest, one of the group’s coordinating the encampment, said that the incidents were not associated with the student protests and that their “priority is the safety of all”, including “not antagonizing counter-protesters or escalating situations unnecessarily”.

In a statement celebrating Passover, Joe Biden released a White House statement addressing the reports, though he did not name Columbia specifically.

“Even in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,” the statement read.

 Columbia holds classes virtually on Monday, while Yale protesters are arrested
On Monday, as the encampment still continued and the university’s gates remained closed to the public, Shafik announced the university will be holding classes virtually on Monday.

“The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. Those tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas,” Shafik said. “We need a reset.”

In New Haven, Connecticut, at least 47 people were arrested at Yale on Monday morning after setting up an encampment on campus Friday night.

“The university made the decision to arrest those individuals who would not leave the plaza with the safety and security of the entire Yale community in mind and to allow access to university facilities by all members of our community,” said a statement from the university.

 A sensitive time on college campuses
The protests at Columbia and other colleges take place at a sensitive time on campuses, which have seen widespread protests, largely calling for ceasefire and divestment, over the last few months.

Recently, university leaders have used harsher measures to clamp down on student protests. In December, Brown arrested 41 students who held a sit-in in a school building. The students were ultimately charged with trespassing.

Earlier this month, Vanderbilt expelled three students out of a group of 27, all who were suspended, who participated in a sit-in protest on campus. A group of 20 students at Pomona College in California were suspended after staging a protest at the office of the university president.

Last week, the University of Southern California faced intense backlash after it canceled the valedictorian speech of a Muslim student because of the “alarming tenor” of reactions to her selection and the “substantial risks relating to security”.

 This article was amended on 23 April 2024. The USC cancelled the valedictorian speech of a Muslim student because of reactions to her selection, not to her speech as stated in an earlier version.","Israel , Gaza and divestment: why are Columbia students protesting?",The Guardian (London),"April 22, 2024 Monday 9:14 PM GMT",0.463019,0.50841117,0.028569836,palestine_guardian1
1,"Israel has made it through to the final of the Eurovision song contest, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged event in Malmö on Saturday.

At Thursday’s second semi-final in Sweden’s third largest city, viewers from the competing countries backed the Israeli singer Eden Golan as one of the 10 entries to progress.

Earlier in the day a demonstration in Malmö’s city centre saw thousands protest against the decision to include Israel while its military campaign in Gaza continues. Further protests, and an alternative concert billed by organisers as a “a song contest without genocide”, are planned for Saturday.

Twenty-six of the 37 entrants will compete in Saturday’s final. After Loreen’s triumph last year, the host and record winner Sweden was guaranteed a place alongside the “big five” of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, which make the biggest financial contributions. The remaining 20 qualified via the semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday.

Israel was allowed to compete this year after it agreed to modify the lyrics of its entry , a ballad widely understood to be a reference the Hamas massacre on 7 October.

The original version of Hurricane, which was titled October Rain, was barred by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaking rules on political neutrality.

Eurovision’s 68th edition takes place seven months into Israel’s bombardment campaign on the Gaza Strip, and just days after the Israel Defense Forces launched a major military offensive in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city.

Golan, 20, who was born in Israel to Russian parents, was booed by members of the audience during dress rehearsals on Wednesday. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, later released a statement in which he praised the singer for “successfully facing a wave of antisemitism while standing and representing the state of Israel with respect”.

Earlier on Thursday, between 5,000 and 6,000 protesters had marched through Malmö city centre to protest against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the country’s inclusion in the event, according to police.

A rally in support of Israel’s inclusion in the contest, held in Malmö’s Hästhagen neighbourhood, drew about 120 people, police in attendance said.

Among the crowd of protesters waving Palestinian flags on Malmö’s town square was Greta Thunberg. “It is outrageous that Israel is allowed to participate”, said the environmental activist, wearing a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh over her shoulders. “We cannot remain silent during a genocide.”

Pro-Palestinian protesters have accused the EBU of double standards. It disqualified Russia from Eurovision in 2022, saying the country’s inclusion would “bring the competition into disrepute”.

The EBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete, saying Eurovision is “a non-political music event” and “not a contest between governments.”

Palestinian flags have been banned inside the venue, but at Tuesday’s semi-final one performer wore a keffiyeh around his wrist.

Eric Saade, whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon, wore the garment while performing his 2011 Eurovision entry Popular. The EBU later said he had compromised “the non-political nature of the event”.

“The EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial,” Saade said in a post on Instagram. “It says nothing about me, but everything about them.”

2,"A spectre is haunting Westminster – the spectre of collective violence against MPs. Large crowds chant noisily outside parliament during debates on Palestine; protesters surround Tobias Ellwood’s house; Jo Stevens’ constituency office is vandalised – and all this against the backdrop of the murders of David Amess and Jo Cox. The parties are united in seeking to exorcise this spectre. It has already led to parliamentary procedure being changed in a way that made a mockery of the debate over violence in Gaza. It has also led to calls for new police powers to curb protests outside parliament. But is collective violence the problem here, and is the introduction of yet more curbs on protest the answer?

Certainly, acts of vandalism and of violence against MPs cast a chill over our democracy and have no justification. But over the past months, a few individual acts have become conflated with the collective protests – and in turn, protest has been equated with violence, or the threat of it.

All this is exemplified by the language of “the mob”. The prime minister has decried “aggressive mobs” as the root of the problem. He is echoed by the home secretary and by the government’s adviser on political violence, John Woodcock , who slams the “aggressive intimidation of MPs” by “mobs”. Referring to crowds as mobs plays into a long tradition that presupposes it is in their nature to be volatile, destructive and violent.

Such negative views of crowds have been around since time immemorial. But they became systematised with industrialisation and the formation of a mass society during the 19th century. The elite feared that the urban masses would, in huge numbers, reject existing hierarchies. Moreover, if the masses were an imminent threat to the social order, the crowd was the mass in action – the sum of all fears.

As the challenge grew, so crowds came to be viewed in more and more negative terms. This was particularly true in France, rocked by defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, by the Paris Commune and by the rising tide of discontent against the Third Republic, which grew from its ashes. In the 1870s there was an average of 80 strikes a year. By the early 1890s that figure grew to more than 400 a year, peaking at 634 in 1893, just before the publication in 1895 of Gustave Le Bon’s book The Crowd – arguably the most influential psychology text ever written.

Le Bon’s account is a litany of loss. In crowds people lose their identity, they lose their rationality, they lose their morality. People “descend several rungs on the ladder of civilisation” on entering the crowd. They become “only powerful for destruction”. Even the most reasonable people lose control of themselves and become bestial in the mass. In a phrase, all crowds are mad, bad and dangerous to know.

There is just one problem with all this. While some crowds clearly can be violent, crowd violence is actually extremely rare. Of the some 2,700 strikes in the period when Le Bon was writing, only 3.6% led to violent acts. In only one – the Decazeville strike of 1886 – was anyone killed. And yet Decazeville haunted Le Bon and his fellow crowd psychologists of the time. For them it was emblematic of all crowds. The exception became the rule.

The same is true today. In recent years, the US has been obsessed by Black Lives Matter protests. It is estimated that between 15 and 26 million people participated in demonstrations in the weeks after George Floyd’s death. There has been much controversy over these events, with many claims of violence and intimidation. But careful analysis by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project showed 93% of events to be peaceful.

In this country, we have generally been more obsessed by the violence of sporting crowds – particularly football hooliganism, the so-called “English disease”. It wasn’t just big in the 1970s and 80s. It might seem that it hasn’t gone away. A couple of years back, the headlines screamed that “football-related arrests rocket amid rise in violent disorder”. But looking more closely at this nightmare image of football crowds, there were 2,198 arrests at football grounds in the 2021-22 season, of which 20% were for violent disorder (a little over 400). In 2022-23 the figures were much the same. There were 2,264 arrests, of which 21% were for violent disorder – and this out of a total of 45 million attendances at games. In other words, there was a one in 100,000 chance of someone attending a game being arrested for being violent – hardly compatible with the idea that crowds are “mobs” in which people are inherently violent.

There is one further twist to this tale. Even where crowd events are violent, the great majority of the violence tends to be inflicted by the authorities, not by crowd members. In England, during the 18th and 19th centuries, more than 600 people died in popular disturbances – all but a handful killed by the yeomanry, cavalry or other such forces. During the US urban riots of the 1960s, the vast majority of those who died were shot by state or federal forces: 14 of the 17 who died in the 1967 Newark riot were shot by officials, while in Detroit in the same year, the figure was 19 out of 29.

Overall, then, the language (and the idea) of the mob paints a false picture of crowds, of crowd violence and of violence in society more generally. The gathering of people in protest does not indicate the imminent outbreak of violence and excess. It cannot, in and of itself, be taken as evidence of intimidation. It is not a threat to our democracy.

On the contrary, crowds and protests are an essential dimension of our democracy. The mark of a healthy society is when everyone feels safe to participate in protest. The more you instil fear of the crowd and the more you place curbs on crowds, the more you narrow participation to those who are prepared to countenance conflict. Moreover, it is precisely when people consider that the authorities are illegitimately blocking their democratic rights to peaceful protest that they are willing to act violently.

The message is clear. You will understand and deal with crowds far better if, as enshrined in international human rights law, you start from the presumption that they are peaceful rather than violent. It is by ignoring this message that our MPs make themselves less safe. Should they seek to make collective protest more difficult, it will increase rather than decrease the dangers they face, and undermine rather than safeguard our democracy. It is high time that we lay the spectre of the “mob” to rest.

3,"Plans to stop UK public bodies boycotting foreign countries and British companies that trade with them represent a further attack on the right to freedom of expression, civil society groups have said.

Officials from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) have said the boycotts, divestment and sanctions bill, announced in last year’s Queen’s speech and designed to stop actions against Israel, will be tabled soon.

The move, first reported by the FT , comes amid anger over the crackdown against protesters at last week’s coronation of King Charles, days after the Public Order Act was given royal assent.
The bill would outlaw campaigns, including those relating to the purchase of goods and services or investments. The government has previously highlighted a 2014 Leicester city council motion banning goods from illegal Israeli settlements, while the communities secretary, Michael Gove, has claimed the Israel-targeting BDS (boycotts, divestment and sanctions) movement is fuelling antisemitism.
However, 60 civil society groups under the right to boycott umbrella claim the bill will stifle social and climate justice campaigns.

Ben Jamal, the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign UK, said it was “yet another example of this government attacking democratic participation”.

He said: “With support growing around the world for the call issued by Palestinian civil society for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, the British government seems determined to shield Israel, and companies involved in its occupation, from accountability for its violations of human rights and international law.

“This bill will weaken campaigns against deforestation, environmental pollution, and the exploitation of children and workers. That is why such a wide range of groups have come together, from trade unions, charities and NGOs, to faith, climate justice, human rights, cultural, campaigning, and solidarity organisations. How can we rely on ministers to uphold ethical standards around the world while they chip away our democratic rights at home?”

In February, despite opposing the BDS movement, the Union of Jewish students passed a motion opposing the bill , saying it would curtail “the democratic right to non-violently protest”.

Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at Liberty, said: “For a government that professes to care about free speech, the proposed anti-boycott bill, once again, shows their flimsy commitment to protecting freedom of expression.

“This bill must be seen in the context of wider government attempts to curb our rights to protest and for people to stand up for what they believe in. This bill sets an extremely dangerous precedent, and its potential impact is harmful and wide-ranging. We urge the government to rethink its plans.”

The bill’s opponents say boycotts, divestment and sanctions have been used to confront injustice historically, including the transatlantic slave trade and apartheid South Africa.
Unison said it could “silence any attempt to shame China’s terrible treatment of the Uyghurs”.

Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said fossil fuel divestment had led to institutions with a combined value of more than $40tn (£32tn) diverting their money away from polluting industries. “Banning public bodies from using these vital tactics unless they support UK foreign policy would be a frightening and authoritarian step,” he said.

A DLUHC spokesperson said it would legislate “as soon as parliamentary time allows”, adding: “We are firmly opposed to local boycotts which can damage integration and community cohesion, hinder exports, and harm our economic security.”","UK anti-boycott bill is attack on freedom of expression, say civil society groups",The Guardian (London),"May 12, 2023 Friday 12:48 PM GMT",0.6115301,0.36514908,0.023320785,palestine_guardian1
4,"University campuses around the world have been the stage of a growing number of protests by students demanding academic institutions divest from companies supplying arms to Israel.

The protests, which first spread across college campuses in the US, have reached universities in the UK, the rest of Europe, as well as Lebanon and India.

The students say they are voicing their opposition to, what they describe as, their university’s “complicity” in Israel’s assault on Gaza that has killed more than 34,700 people. Israel said its military offensive was a response to the attack by Hamas militants on 7 October, when about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.

More than 2,500 demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far, with protests on college campuses attracting global media attention and reaction from Palestinians trapped in the besieged Gaza.

More protests are expected, with the Israeli assault on Rafah drawing international condemnation. Some students have begun hunger strikes in protest against their university’s “silence and inaction”.

 Where are the protests happening?
Demonstrations have been staged at nearly 140 college campuses in the US, spanning 45 states and Washington DC since protests began at Columbia University in New York. 

Dramatic scenes unfolded at Columbia about a week ago when more than 100 students were arrested after police officers entered the campus. 

The university called on the police to tackle demonstrators who had occupied Hamilton Hall, renaming it Hind’s Hall, after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza. 

Afterwards, Joe Biden, rejected claims that the protests were non-violent. “Destroying property is not a peaceful protest; it’s against the law,” the US president said.

Biden added: “There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans.”

Since then, students at about 14 UK universities have also set up encampments.

Hala Hanina, a Palestinian student who has been involved in protests at the Newcastle University, said: “It’s so important for the student community and British community that they are fighting for justice.”

More than a dozen students at Princetonand 10 students at Edinburgh have said they will begin a hunger strike in protest at their university’s policies.

Prof Peter Mathieson, the principal and vice-chancellor at Edinburgh, said: “We have very recently been notified of the intention of an unknown number of students to commence a hunger strike as an indication of their strength of feeling and determination around issues related to Palestine and Israel.

“While we recognise their bodily autonomy, we appeal to them and others not to take risks with their own health, safety and wellbeing. We are in daily contact with the protesters to ensure they are aware of the health and wellbeing support available to them.”

 What is the situation in mainland Europe?
Small protests have taken place at universities including in France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, although most were swiftly cleared by police.

The largest was at the University of Amsterdam where riot police, acting at the request of university authorities, city hall and public prosecutors, moved in early on Tuesday morning to break up an encampment that had sprung up on Monday.

Police used a mechanical digger to break down barricades of pallets and bicycles erected by the protesters and used batons to disperse the crowd – 125 of whom refused to leaveand were arrested. Most were released after a few hours.

The university said: “We share the anger and bewilderment over the war, and we understand that there are protests over it. We stress that within the university, dialogue about it is the only answer.”

 What are the student protesters calling for?
Many want universities to sell off shares, assets or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment.

Activists say universities and colleges investing in Israeli companies or organisations doing business in Israel are “complicit” in the war in Gaza. 

The protesters are also calling for a ceasefire, for universities to acknowledge the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory as a “genocide” and to “condemn the destruction of all of Gaza’s universities”.

Some students have also fused their demands on Gaza with their calls for universities to help tackle the climate crisis.

More than 100 students occupied Ghent University in Belgium calling for concrete action to meet the institution’s 2030 climate plans, as well as demanding it cuts ties with companies connected to the Israeli military.

The university did not respond to a request for comment but its director, Rick Van de Walle, posted a statement saying its ethical policies would not change, adding: “No deviation from the existing human rights policy will be used with regard to one particular country, in this case Israel.”
 How have universities responded?
There has been a varied response from academic institutions to student protests, ranging from dramatic crackdowns to negotiations. 

Brown University in Rhode Island brokered an agreement with students last week that the institution’s highest governing body, the Corporation, would vote on divestment from companies affiliated with Israel during a meeting in October. In return, students cleared the encampments.

Northwestern University in Illinois and the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, have also reached agreements with students, while Columbia has called off its main graduation ceremony.  

An occupation at Goldsmiths in London also came to an end after the university agreed to the students’ demands, including the renaming of a lecture hall after the Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, humanitarian scholarships for Palestinian students and a review of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism.",Why have student protests against Israel ’s war in Gaza gone global?,The Guardian (London),"May 8, 2024 Wednesday 12:14 PM GMT",0.640924,0.33671293,0.022363117,palestine_guardian1
5,"Nine people have been arrested after a banner with a pro-Palestinian slogan was displayed on a building in central London.

The banner, which read “globalise the intifada”, was hung outside a building in Park Square, near Regent’s Park, on Tuesday.

The Metropolitan police said the building, a large Georgian terrace in one of the most expensive parts of London, was being used by squatters but had now been secured.

The Arabic word “intifada” means shaking off or struggle and is often used to describe periods of uprising, some of them involving the use of terrorism, by Palestinians in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Police said the arrests had been carried out under section 18 of the Public Order Act, which prohibits the display of “any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting” if the intention or likely consequence is to stir up racial hatred.

They said the banner had been removed and they would maintain a presence in the area to respond to “any further incidents”. Officers had left the scene by 4.30pm, the PA news agency reported.

When asked on 30 October about language used at some pro-Palestinian protests, an official spokesperson for the prime minister said calling for intifada was “obviously … not acceptable”.

Referring to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, the spokesperson added: “People need to think extremely carefully about the impact of their actions following a traumatic terror event which saw more than 1,000 people killed.”

The pro-Palestinian protests of recent weeks have brought renewed debate about freedom of speech and whether certain slogans constitute calls for violence or even genocide.

Among the most controversial has been a chant, frequently heard at the demonstrations, that states: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”

Activists have argued that the phrase is only a call for freedom and human rights for Palestinians, but in a letter to senior police officers in October Suella Braverman, then the home secretary, said it could be understood as an “expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world”.

She said that in certain contexts using the slogan could amount to a racially aggravated public order offence.",Nine arrested over pro- Palestinian banner in London,The Guardian (London),"December 5, 2023 Tuesday 8:12 PM GMT",0.64207244,0.34020516,0.017722407,palestine_guardian1
6,"Students demonstrating in solidarity with Gaza waved Palestinian flags and keffiyehs and chanted anti-war slogans during the University of Michigan’s commencement ceremony on Saturday.

Videos on social media showed students donning their graduation gowns as they appeared to chant : “Israel bombs, UMich pays!” and “How many kids have you killed today?” One photo showed a plane appearing to carry a sky banner over the university with the message: “Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!”

According to the Associated Press, one banner read: “No universities left in Gaza.”

At one point, several graduates appeared to stage a walkout from the ceremony while carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs as onlooking students applauded.

The protest, along with numerous other student-led protests across US universities, comes amid Israel’s deadly war on Gaza since Hamas’s 7 October attacks that killed more than 1,100 Israelis. In response, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians across Gaza while leaving 2 million survivors displaced across the narrow strip amid a famine caused by Israeli restrictions on aid.

Israel has also destroyed every university in Gaza, in addition to killing at least 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors, according to the UN, which has condemned Israel’s actions as “scholasticide”.

No arrests were reported during the University of Michigan ceremony, which comprised tens of thousands of attendees, the Associated Press reports, adding that as US navy secretary Carlos Del Toro addressed the crowd, he at one point said: “Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium.”

While administering an oath to the armed forces graduates, Del Toro said they would “protect the freedoms that we so cherish”, including “the right to protest peacefully”, according to the Associated Press.

On Monday, University of Michigan students set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment on campus in calls for the university to divest from companies with investments in Israel. The encampment was led by Tahrir, a coalition of more than 80 organizations including the university chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the Michigan Daily reports.

Pictures online showed various hand-painted signs at the encampment including ones that read : “Faculty and staff for liberation” and “Apartheid isn’t kosher! Jews demand divestment!”

On Friday, police arrested a pro-Palestinian protester outside the University of Michigan’s Museum of Art, the Detroit News reports , adding that police used a chemical spray to disperse students. According to a university spokesperson who spoke to the outlet, a dinner was held at the museum on Friday to recognize those receiving honorary degrees from the university.

One video online appeared to show Sarah Hubbard, chair of the university’s board of regents, waving and appearing to film students from inside the museum as they chanted: “Regent Hubbard, you can’t hide, you are funding genocide!”

In recent weeks, more than 2,000 people have been arrested during Palestinian solidarity and anti-war protests on US college campuses. University leaders have been heavily criticized across the country for authorizing police forces to conduct arrests on campus, many of which have been carried out violently.

At the University of Virginia, 25 people were arrested on Saturday for trespassing after police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters who refused to remove tents from campus.

At Columbia University in New York, the Columbia Spectator reported police using stun grenades on the anti-war protesters while carrying out arrests. The Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed that a police officer fired a gun during the arrests.

At the University of California, Los Angeles, videos online showed police in riot gear firing rubber bullets on campus, with anti-war student protesters saying that multiple people had been shot in the head.

Other videos surfacing online throughout the week showed multiple faculty members at various universities being violently arrested by police. In a post on X, Steve Tamari, a 65-year-old Middle East historian at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, said that he had been “body-slammed and crushed by the weight of several St Louis county police officers, then dragged across campus by the police”. In addition to broken ribs, Tamari said he sustained a broken hand.",Student protesters interrupt University of Michigan commencement,The Guardian (London),"May 4, 2024 Saturday 9:43 PM GMT",0.68309015,0.29775986,0.019149996,palestine_guardian1
7,"As demonstrations over the war in Gaza have surged on campuses, around cities and in offices across the US in recent weeks, a visible tension has emerged between the desire for public protest and a fear of professional reprisals.

On the Columbia University campus, where the latest spike in protests began on 17 April, demonstrators have worn masks and used blankets to block counter-protesters from filming students. Protesters at a tent encampment at the University of Michigan handed out masks upon entry, and students there refused to give reporters their full names in case the school took punitive action against them. At Harvard, the Palestine Solidarity Committee told the Guardian it had suspended doing press interviews out of regard for student safety.

Concerns over retaliation and harassment have permeated the protests, as an intense and organized effort to bring down personal and professional repercussions on demonstrators has played out online. Counter-protesters and pro-Israel activist groups have attempted to post demonstrators’ faces and personal information to intimidate them, an act known as doxing, and demanded that pro-Palestinian protesters remove their masks at rallies. The professional threat is not theoretical: employers have terminated workers over their comments about the Israel-Gaza war , and CEOs have demanded universities name protesters so as to blacklist them.

The result is that the public face of a nationwide student movement is often a covered one. Photos and videos from demonstrations show swaths of students either wearing keffiyehs – headdresses that have become a symbol of Palestinian solidarity – or medical masks that obscure their identity. During Yale’s protests , a 21-person choir sang This Little Light of Mine with masks over their faces.

Administrators have admonished students against wearing masks, in at least one case citing anti-mask laws from the 1950s originally intended to deter the Ku Klux Klan from holding rallies. At the University of North Carolina, the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine said that it was alarmed to receive an email from a university official citing campus policy and state law against wearing masks. The university did not dispute the email, telling the Guardian that an administrator was reminding an organization with a history of wearing face coverings about the policy.

At the University of Austin, Texas, the dean of students sent a letter canceling a campus demonstration and said that an organizer’s Instagram post telling protesters to bring masks would be a violation of school policy against obstructing law enforcement. The protest took place anyway, leading to state and local police arresting dozens of people for trespassing, including a local Fox journalist who was photographing the event. Pro-Israel activists have similarly called for demonstrators to take off their masks during heated counter-protests, while head of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, recently called for some coverings to be outlawed entirely.

“Masks that cover the entire face have no bearing on Covid or free speech and should be banned on all college campuses effective immediately,” Greenblatt tweeted.

While protesters are covering their faces to prevent harassment and retaliation, they also cited Covid concerns as an additional reason to mask up while attending mass gatherings. The ubiquity of masks, according to one organizer, was representative of a general concern for everyone demonstrating and the potential harm they face as a result.

“I don’t see it as coming top-down from organizations but more from within protest communities about how to keep each other safe,” said Liv Kunins-Berkowitz, a media coordinator for the activist group Jewish Voice For Peace. “That includes keeping yourself safe from surveillance and from having your photo posted all over the internet.”

 Doxings, firings and harassment
Since the start of the Israel-Gaza war in October last year, many pro-Palestinian demonstrators have had their personal information posted online and faced firings, suspensions and harassment. While some protesters have had their names, occupations and social media profiles posted after being filmed expressing blatantly antisemitic rhetoric or statements supporting Hamas, organized doxing efforts have also swept up people who have peacefully attended rallies, signed letters calling for a ceasefire or publicly criticized Israel.

As arrests at protests have surged and some lawmakers have called for sending in the national guard against demonstrators, the amount of surveillance at protests has also increased. The New York police department has deployed drones to monitor demonstrations, track movements and capture video footage, with the department saying it would use those recordings to help make arrests.

“At least in New York City, there’s a very big concern around police surveillance,” said one protester, who asked not to be named out of fear of personal and professional harm. They added that some organizers specifically told demonstrators to cover their faces and handed out masks at protests.

In the early weeks of protests against the war, the conservative group Accuracy In Media launched a campaign at Harvard that posted the names and faces of students who signed a pro-Palestinian open letter on the side of a billboard truck and branded them “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites”. It later expanded to other universities and created individualized websites branding students as antisemitic, leading to a lawsuit from one student and Columbia forming a Doxing Resource Group. Several other pro-Israel organizations, such as StopAntisemitism , have similarly dedicated websites and social media accounts to posting the personal information of protesters. People have described receiving death threats, harassment and being fired from their work after being featured in StopAntisemitism’s posts.

Another anonymously run site features hundreds of profiles of people who have been critical of Israel’s actions or taken part in protests, posting their social media profiles, occupations, home towns and photos of their faces. The site has specific lists for students and faculty, accusing them of antisemitism and supporting terrorism for signing open letters calling for ceasefire, affiliation with pro-Palestinian groups or being in attendance at anti-war rallies. These profiles now show up as top Google results when searching for the names of many of the people listed on the site, especially students with a smaller online presence.

Israeli authorities have also used information from that doxing website when making decisions to bar political activists from entering the country, Haaretz reported.
Concealing identity while protesting has a long history in the United States, and in recent decades has been a tactic commonly associated with anticapitalist activists at government summits or antifascists counter-protesting far-right rallies. Mask-wearing became enough of a hallmark of leftist protests that, in 2018, Republicans attempted to pass a vague anti-antifa bill that would have punished anyone protesting in a mask and acting in a threatening manner with up to 15 years in prison.

Several major events in recent years have additionally changed the way that people protest and their ability to remain anonymous. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic vastly changed the ubiquity of masks, as well as provided a loophole for many anti-mask policies and state laws around protesting with a concealed identity. The January 6 Capitol riots and subsequent search for perpetrators also highlighted how video footage and facial recognition technology can be used to easily identify people online. Self-appointed citizen investigators combed through videos for months after the attack, coordinating online to identify rioters and refer them to law enforcement officials.

 Protesters mask up in the office
The desire for anonymity has extended beyond college campuses to other pro-Palestinian demonstrations. When Google employees held a sit-in to protest against the company’s $1.2bn contract with the Israeli government and its military, many covered their faces out of fear of online harassment.

“Doxing is the main reason that people chose to conceal their identity in relation to this protest,” said a former Google worker who was fired for taking part in the demonstration.

Pro-Palestinian protesters at Google had been concerned for some time about other employees harassing them or leaking their personal information online, two former workers told the Guardian. Google fired more than 50 people over the course of several days for taking part in the protests against its Project Nimbus program.
Several fired workers continued to obscure their identities during a press conference in the days after the firing, out of worry that it would threaten future job prospects.

Google said in a statement that some fired employees “took longer to identify because their identity was partly concealed – like by wearing a mask without their badge – while engaged in the disruption.”",Why are pro- Palestinian US student protesters wearing masks on campus?,The Guardian (London),"April 30, 2024 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMT",0.52770007,0.45055088,0.021749062,palestine_guardian1
8,"Michigan is holding its presidential primaries on Tuesday, with campaigns by pro-Palestine activists to abandon Joe Biden and factional chaos in the state Republican party defining an otherwise sleepy election day.

There’s little drama in predicting the winners: Biden and Donald Trump are expected to romp in their respective races. But the dynamics of the contests hint at the deep divisions within the Democratic and Republican camps as the nationally unpopular candidates prepare to square off in a presidential general election rematch this fall.

Neither candidate is popular statewide. Only 17% of respondents in a January poll commissioned by the Detroit News said they believed Biden deserved a second term in office, while 33% said the same about Trump. When asked whether they would support Trump or Biden in the general, respondents favored Trump by 8 points.

Neither candidate faces much opposition in their respective primaries. Trump’s only serious foe is the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whom he just beat by a wide margin in her home-state primary on Saturday.

Biden’s greatest threat isn’t a candidate, but a movement: activists have launched a coordinated campaign to withhold votes from Biden to protest against his support for Israel’s war in Gaza. If they are successful, their efforts could embarrass him in the critical swing state – which has one of the largest Arab American communities in the country.

They are furious at Biden for his unwavering support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 people.

Eyeing this primary as an opportunity to pressure the president to revise his position on the war, a coalition of activists are calling on Democratic voters to select “uncommitted” on their ballot. The Listen to Michigan campaign, which activists launched in early February, has gained traction among some prominent political figures on the left, including the progressive former congressman Andy Levin and the US representative Rashida Tlaib, whose sister is spearheading the campaign.

“President Biden needs every vote he can get if he’s going to prevent Donald Trump and his white supremacist buddies from taking the White House again,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesperson for the Listen to Michigan campaign and the former chief of staff for the Missouri congresswoman Cori Bush. “Our votes on February 27 for ‘uncommitted’ hopefully will be a reminder of that.”

It’s not the first time Michigan Democrats have rallied around the “uncommitted” vote. In 2008, the Michigan Democratic party generated outrage by moving their primary to 15 January, shaking up the presidential primary order and prompting most candidates to drop out in protest. With Hillary Clinton as the only real contender on the ballot, a movement to vote “uncommitted” took hold. Nearly 40% of voters chose “uncommitted”, an embarrassment for Clinton and an early win for former president Barack Obama’s campaign.

In the 2012 Michigan Democratic primary, nearly 21,000 people voted “uncommitted” instead of for Obama – more than 10% of the total votes cast.

Alawieh argued that one metric for measuring the campaign’s success would be 10,000 people casting their votes as “uncommitted”, given that Trump won the state by roughly that margin in 2016.

“If we see that at least that many people vote for ‘uncommitted’, I think that sends a very, very strong message,” said Alawieh.

 ***
On the Republican side, a very different kind of split has driven the state party into feuding factions – making an already logistically complicated election even more confusing.

Trump is expected to beat Haley definitively in Tuesday’s primary. The primary margins and turnout will be telling, however – especially in traditionally Republican areas that have shifted away from the GOP during the Trump era, like parts of western Michigan and Detroit’s more upscale suburbs.

But the real chaos isn’t for the primary – it’s for the state convention that is scheduled a few days later. Or, to be more precise, the state party conventions: right now, two warring factions have scheduled their own meetings, and it’s not totally clear which meeting’s delegates will count towards the presidential nomination.

The Michigan Republican party is holding a separate caucus on 2 March to comply with Republican National Committee rules after Michigan’s Democrat-controlled state legislature moved the state’s primary date earlier than the RNC permitted. The winner of Tuesday’s primary will earn only 30% of the state’s delegates – party activists who vote at the Republican national convention to nominate the presidential candidate – while 70% will be chosen at a state party convention on Saturday.

Chaos within the state party has further complicated that plan.

In early January, a group of party activists held an election to oust the former Michigan GOP chairwoman, Kristina Karamo, accusing the fervent conspiracy theorist of mismanaging the state party’s finances. They later voted to replace her with Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and Trump’s former US ambassador to the Netherlands. On 14 February, the Republican National Committee declared their support for Hoekstra, recognizing him as the official state party chair.

Karamo has continued to claim she is the rightful chair of the party despite what the RNC says, and is forging ahead with her own plans for a party convention on Saturday near Detroit even as Hoekstra plans one in Grand Rapids, a few hours away.

“The political oligarchy within the Republican party has done everything possible to destroy me,” Karamo said in a podcast released just days after the RNC officially recognized Hoekstra’s leadership on 14 February.

Given the national party’s support for Hoekstra, it’s unlikely Karamo’s convention will carry any official weight. But the courts may have something to say about that.

On the same day voters head to the polls on Tuesday, the dueling factions will see each other in Kent county district court. Karamo’s opponents are asking a judge to determine whether she was properly removed from office, in hopes that a legal finding will push her to step down, allow them to seize control of the party’s finances and confirm that Hoekstra’s convention is the official one.

All that drama is overshadowing the primary.

“A good strong showing for Trump with a high turnout in key areas will bolster the Republican party if they can pull it off,” said Ken Kollman, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan. “But they’re riven by pretty deep splits right now.”

9,"Voters in Wisconsin cast their ballots today in an election that will test voter enthusiasm for Joe Biden and Donald Trump – and potentially enshrine two amendments in the state constitution affecting election administration across the state.

The president and former president are already the presumptive nominees and will almost certainly face off in the general election in November, and it seems that the threat of prosecution, general unpopularity and advanced age can’t stop them.

But while the primary will not offer alternative candidates, a group of activists in Wisconsin see it as an opportunity to push Biden on his policy toward Israel’s war on Gaza. The organizers, inspired by Michigan’s “uncommitted” campaign , which garnered more than 100,000 votes there, are calling on voters to choose “uninstructed” instead of Biden.

“The margins of our elections are so incredibly close – less than 1% in the last two presidential election cycles – so I think it would behoove the administration to pay attention,” said Reema Ahmad, the lead organizer of the Listen to Wisconsin campaign.

Organizers with the campaign aim to turn out as many voters for “uninstructed” as Biden’s margin of victory in 2020 to demonstrate their critical role in November, Ahmad said. The campaign has relied on the support of a broad network of progressive organizations, including the state’s largest network of Latino voters, Voces de la Frontera Action and Black Leaders Organizing Communities (Bloc), groups that helped propel Biden to his narrow 2020 victory.

Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York also hold presidential primaries today, and voters in Arkansas and Mississippi will participate in primary runoffs. Voters in Rhode Island and Connecticut will also have an “uncommitted” option on the ballot, and in New York, pro-Palestine activists are encouraging voters to leave their presidential primary options blank in protest.

The Trump campaign faces no similar challenge within the party, making Republican discontent with him harder to gauge. On 6 March, the former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, whose campaign gave anti-Trump Republicans a means to show their frustration with him, dropped out, and Trump snapped up enough delegates to secure the GOP nomination less than a week later. Haley and four other Republicans will still appear on the Wisconsin ballot alongside Trump.

Brandon Scholz, a retired Wisconsin GOP strategist, said primary turnout could lend some insight into how both candidates will fare in November. In 2020, Biden clawed back parts of the country that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 – especially in the suburbs, and especially suburban women. Biden also benefited from strong support from Black and Latino voters – groups that recent polls show could be slipping away from him .

“You want to do what you can to turn your base – your hardcore Dems and your hardcore Republicans, you want to be able to get them to the polls, because the last thing you want to do is come out looking like you didn’t do anything,” Scholz said.

Whether or not the Trump campaign will mobilize voters outside the Maga movement is another question.

“Observers will look to see what sort of participation traditional Republicans will have in this primary,” said Scholz. “And then finally, for both campaigns what are the ‘double haters’ going to do?”

Also on the ballot in Wisconsin are two constitutional amendments that voting rights and government watchdog groups warn could have a negative impact on elections administration in the state.

The first proposed amendment, which would ban elections offices from accepting private grant money to fund their operations, comes amid GOP anxieties – and election-denying conspiracy theories – about the role of funding from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s Center for Tech and Civic Life. During the 2020 election, the Facebook co-founder and his wife used funding from their organization to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in polling places and send voters information during the 2020 election.

The donations from Center for Tech and Civic Life became a key focus of Republicans, many of them activists who questioned the results of the 2020 election. “Zuckerbucks”, they argue, unfairly benefited Democratic strongholds – although there is no evidence that the grants, which reached small and large municipalities across the state, played a role in Biden’s victory.

The second proposed amendment would enshrine in the state constitution a provision that already exists in Wisconsin statute, mandating that “only election officials designated by law may perform tasks in the conduct of primaries, elections, and referendums”.

Both proposals were passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature, which sent them to voters after the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, vetoed them. And both, worries Debra Cronmiller, the executive director of Wisconsin’s League of Women Voters, could hurt voters.

“There’s no guarantee that the election will be funded fully in the absence of outside money,” said Cronmiller, of the proposal to ban elections offices from accessing private grants. Without sufficient funding – and the state legislature has not proposed additional resources to elections offices – she argued towns and counties are forced to hire fewer poll workers and host fewer polling locations, causing longer lines and a slower tally of the votes and disproportionately impacting poorer and smaller towns.

“They might not have the opportunities that a bigger municipality, that has deeper pockets, might have in order to serve their citizens,” she said.

The second proposed amendment, Cronmiller and other elections experts and voter advocates say, could prevent non-profits and other third-party groups from assisting voters in critical ways during elections. Groups that assist in driving voters to the polls, provide residents with information about voter registration, or help in the recruitment of poll workers, for example, could find themselves facing legal challenges for their work.

“We’re all scratching our heads and wondering: is this allowed? If this passes, and if we don’t do those things, how do voters get to the polls?” said Cronmiller.

10,"When I first moved to England for university, I took a course on the European Union. I remember my professor’s opening gambit was telling us that if we wanted to know how different countries felt about each other, we had to watch Eurovision. So like any good student, I sat down for my first Eurovision song contest in May 2016. Just a month before the UK voted to leave the EU, I watched as Joe and Jake placed a humiliating 24th out of 26 entries. Safe to say, I learned my lesson that evening.

After that, Eurovision became a sacred viewing tradition among me and my friends – one that I must now give up. Instead of watching Eurovision this year, I will be joining the boycott of the song contest.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, has given Israel the green light to compete. The EBU’s outrageous decision flies in the face of everything the song contest is designed to represent: peace, unity and cooperation. One in 20 people who were living in Gaza a year ago are now either dead, injured or missing owing to the actions of the Israeli state. How can a country whose assault on Gaza has so far claimed more than 30,000 lives be allowed to compete?

Israel’s participation in this year’s contest exposes the double standards and glaring hypocrisy embedded in the EBU’s opaque processes for defining what counts as “political”. Just one day after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the EBU banned Russian participation, stating that “in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry … would bring the competition into disrepute.”

For months, the EBU has been under increasing pressure to bar Israel from competing this year. Musicians from Finland, Iceland , Norway , Denmark and even Sweden (this year’s host country) have all signed open letters urging their respective national broadcasters to push for Israel to be banned. Iceland has also indicated it could withdraw from the contest entirely given the circumstances. Elsewhere, an online petition started in December aimed at the EBU’s director general has garnered almost 50,000 signatures.
When the lyrics from Israel’s initial entry, October Rain, leaked in February, it looked as if – for the briefest moment – the EBU would refuse Israel a place. The EBU rejected the ballad as its verses seemingly contained references to the 7 October massacre by Hamas (which has been used by the Israeli government to justify the continuing assault in Gaza) and consequently breached Eurovision’s rules on political neutrality.

At first, Kan, Israel’s state broadcaster, was defiant and refused the EBU’s request to change the lyrics. The standoff was only broken when Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, intervened to work with Kan on changing the lyrics to suit Eurovision’s criteria. Now entitled Hurricane, the song has been approved by the EBU and so Israel will be in the competition this year. Though it’s surely mere coincidence that Hurricane rhymes with October Rain.

While the EBU has put out statements trying to clarify why it treats Russia and Israel differently, the fact remains that the EBU has stayed painfully silent on the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. For many Eurovision fans, myself included, this isn’t just a missed opportunity. The EBU had an opportunity to step towards righting the contest’s historical wrongs. At the 2019 competition in Tel Aviv, Eurovision fined Iceland’s broadcaster after Hatari, the Icelandic entry, waved a Palestinian flag during the broadcast. The EBU also censored the band’s protest in the official DVD recording of the contest.
There is no moral or ethical way to watch Eurovision this year. No amount of mental gymnastics in my head can see it make sense. A boycott is the only option, and we must also go further. When Israel hosted Eurovision in 2019, an alternative Globalvision was organised by Palestinians in London, Dublin, Ramallah and Haifa on the same day to raise awareness of the occupation, but also to highlight “the original values of Eurovision, which is inclusion and diversity”.
I hope that in the run-up to 11 May, these alternative Eurovision events will return and can be a place where we channel our energy and support. Venues that were planning on live screening the finale should instead consider hosting fundraising events for organisations like Medical Aid for Palestinians. Silence on this humanitarian crisis should be viewed as complicity – our actions matter more than ever.

For all of Eurovision’s pontificating about its apolitical nature, the contest has always been governed by political division and questions of inclusion and exclusion. Nowhere has that been clearer than in the incredibly moving shows and songs of support and solidarity for Ukraine over the past two years. Given Eurovision’s record, it’s hard to believe this year’s broadcast will allow any similar signs of support for Palestine.

The reality we are in is that both Russia and Israel are engaged in illegal invasions of other territories. Yet only one of them has been given the chance to perform on the world stage with more than 160 million viewers. Why is it that the value of “unity in music” only stretches to Ukraine? If we as Eurovision fans want to honour the competition’s spirit of peace and cooperation, we have no choice but to boycott.

11,"Hizb ut-Tahrir, the revolutionary Islamist organisation that is to be banned from organising in the UK, has been agitating and recruiting in Britain for nearly 40 years.

A ban on the group, which has been called “antisemitic” by the home secretary, James Cleverly, will come into force on Friday if approved by parliament, in a move that will put it on a par with al-Qaida and Islamic State.

 What are the group’s origins ?
Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), whose name translates into English as “party of Liberation”, was founded in 1953 in Jordan by Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, an Islamist intellectual and Palestinian graduate of an Egyptian university.

Nabhani’s focus was Arab unification based on Islam, as opposed to the secular ideology of pan-Arabism which was in the ascendancy at the time.

Originally, HT’s main method of trying to gain power was by infiltrating militaries in countries with Muslim majorities. It was behind failed attempts to stage coups in Jordan, Iraq and Syria in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Its first European branch was established in the 1960s in West Germany and it soon spread to dozens of other countries.

 What does it want?
Its official aim has been to re-establish the Islamic caliphate, a reference to the original caliphate that flourished briefly after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632.

But while it claims to disavow violence, the ultimate aim of its totalitarian ideology is the imposition of sharia law worldwide and the destruction of Israel. This particularly narrow interpretation of Islam means that it views universal human rights as concepts that are antithetical to Islam, regarding them as a western construction.

 What has been its role in the UK?
HT was first established in Britain in 1986, focusing initially on Muslims who were living in the UK temporarily and setting up study groups.

It moved from organising protests outside embassies to recruiting young second-generation British Muslims on campuses. After it encountered opposition from the National Union of Students (NUS) and others, it pivoted towards creating front-groups based around single issues.

Key figures have included Omar Bakri Muhammad , who founded the UK branch of HT and remained leader until 1996, as well as Abdul Wahid , a doctor who has been the chair of its British branch.

 Why has it not been banned before?
Several countries – including Germany, Egypt, Pakistan and several central-Asian and Arab countries – have banned HT, while the group has been the subject of political controversy in the UK for decades.

Tony Blair said that he would ban the group shortly after the 7/7 bombings in 2005 as part of a plan to combat Islamist extremism, but then dropped the plan amid reservations from the Home Office and senior police officers, who feared this would backfire in terms of boosting recruitment.

Successive home secretaries have also mulled enacting a ban, but decided against it – including Theresa May, who said she wanted to but had opted not to on the basis of legal advice.

 What has changed now?
A catalyst for the ban has been the increased spotlight on the activities of HT in recent months amid street protests sparked by the Israel-Gaza conflict.

The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, said hate crime laws “probably need redrawing” as the force came under pressure over its policing of a pro-Palestinian protest in London.

The force also issued a statement saying it was taking no further action after footage appeared online of a man chanting “jihad, jihad” at a smaller rally organised by HT.

Announcing the move to ban the groups’s activities, Cleverly specifically referenced its praise for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people.

Since those events, HT had not condemned Hamas, a group already proscribed in the UK, but instead had hailed the attacks on Israeli citizens by saying: “If this can be done by a resistance group, imagine what a unified response from the Muslim world could achieve.”

Its praise for those attacks and description of Hamas as heroes on its website constituted promoting and encouraging terrorism, Cleverly said. HT has denied it was antisemitic, saying: “We do not support the Hamas group, but support the people of Palestine.”",What is ‘antisemitic’ Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir and what does it want?,The Guardian (London),"January 15, 2024 Monday 7:46 PM GMT",0.4061996,0.56317115,0.030629303,palestine_guardian1
12,"The horror of it is beyond my capacity to describe. On Sunday afternoon, a US air force airman named Aaron Bushnell doused himself in gasoline outside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC and lit himself on fire. His phone was propped on the ground nearby, livestreaming to Twitch. “I will no longer be complicit in genocide,” Bushnell said. “I am about to engage in an extreme act of protest. But compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it’s not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal.” Then he set fire to his body and screamed, “Free Palestine.” Bushnell died at a nearby hospital some nine hours later. He was 25.

Bushnell’s political self-killing has opened a rupture in American political discourse, dividing even those with a commitment to the Palestinian cause and a fervent opposition to US aid to Israel. Bushnell’s slow and violent death, the terrifying spectacle of it and its brutal irreversibility, have proved profoundly disturbing to many. There have been wild speculations about his mental health. (“Who but an insane person would do such a thing?” some wonder; as if this question could not be asked of Israel’s war itself.) And there have been, too, fervent calls for caution, for reporters and commentators to write about the act in ways that will not encourage others to follow Bushnell’s lead.

At the same time, there have been some in the pro-Palestine camp who have expressed a humble admiration for Bushnell’s act, revering not only his clarity of principle and self-sacrifice but also the drama and severity of his act, something that seems, finally, appropriate to the scale of their outrage on behalf of Gaza’s nearly 30,000 dead. Disturbingly, neither Bushnell’s admirers nor his critics seem to share my own conviction: that a person of such profound commitment and depth of feeling could be much more useful to the world if he were alive.

Acts of self-immolation use a grotesque display of self-sacrifice to draw the public’s attention to an issue, to force them into moral witness

I do not pretend to know the state of Bushnell’s mental health, to be able to parse the degree to which his political commitments may have mixed with other struggles to produce his self-killing. That is a question we will never be able to answer. Perhaps more importantly, it feels like the wrong question to ask, a way to avoid confrontation with the stated meaning of Bushnell’s self-immolation: that Israel is conducting a genocide in Gaza, one that is only possible with US money and US support, and that this moral catastrophe implicates all Americans in complicity. This is a serious proposition; one need not condone killing oneself in order to believe that it is worth taking seriously.

Acts of self-immolation are rare, but they have a clear intent: to use a grotesque display of self-sacrifice to draw the public’s attention to an issue, to force them into moral witness. This was the intent of the most famous self-immolation suicide protester, the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc, who set himself on fire in Saigon in June of 1963 to protest against the treatment of Buddhists by the Catholic-run government. And in America, it was the aim of Norman Morrison, the most famous of several Vietnam war-era self-immolators in the United States, who set himself on fire outside the Pentagon, directly beneath the office of the defense secretary Robert McNamara. These people become vivid symbols of their struggles, their deaths acting as indictments of the political systems that oppress and fail them.

The grim truth is that self-immolation is making something of a revival as a leftwing protest tactic in the United States. David Buckel , an environmental activist, self-immolated in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park in protest of the climate crisis in 2018. Another climate activist, Wynn Bruce, took his own life in the same manner on the steps of the US supreme court in 2022. Nor is Bushnell the first protester to self-immolate in protest of Israel’s war on Gaza: a woman set herself on fire outside the Israeli consulate in Atlanta in December; police say that a Palestinian flag was found at the scene.

The revival of this tactic might be best understood as a product of our sclerotic political system, one which has long seemed impervious to less gruesome acts of protest. The self-immolation of the Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in December 2010 prompted the Arab Spring and opened a decade of resurgent leftwing political activism, one that included such American social movements as Occupy Wall Street, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, and a new infusion of energy into the labor movement. But more than a decade on, these protest movements have achieved few substantial gains. The Democratic party has moved marginally to the left, but remains unable to enact policy and is beholden to an overstretched coalition; neither racial justice, nor the climate crisis, nor economic inequality have received the sustained attention of the ruling class. Under such circumstances, political despair is inevitable, and a sense of the futility of existing avenues of dissent is not unreasonable. Maybe these are the conditions that make something so terrible as a protest suicide seem useful.

The horrible question, now, is whether such a horrible sacrifice will actually affect policy, or whether it will be calmly assimilated into the status quo. Self-immolations always make a moral statement; it is unclear whether they make a material difference.

America is no stranger to political violence. But usually, it comes from the right. Mass shootings are routinely carried out in public in America by men with far-right political agendas, who massacre church worshippers, grocery shoppers or high school students in the service of a cause; the death toll from these explicitly political atrocities has been assimilated into our social fabric, hardly registered as assaults made on behalf of a movement. Meanwhile, far-right militias, from the polo-wearing Proud Boys to the masked and khakied Patriot Front, hold parades meant to intimidate their political enemies and the populations they consider undesirable. Sometimes, they threaten or beat people; sometimes, they surround state capitols with guns on display. Once, they stormed the Capitol. Rightwing political violence is likely to shape the 2024 election, and barring the emergence of a dramatically different political settlement, it will be a feature of American life for the foreseeable future.

But the left, by contrast, is a much less violent group. There was incidental property violence at Occupy and during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests; every now and then, during the Trump administration, some black-clad anarchists would show up at a Nazi rally and throw a punch. But this violence is sporadic, not programmatic; it is neither a primary feature nor an end of the American left. Self-immolations are an exception: a kind of violence the left commits. But these, too, are different from rightwing violence in one morally crucial respect: those who commit self-immolation do not kill anyone but themselves.

Why has the left not produced more political violence? You would think that the more violent side would be the more desperate side – the ones who are always losing. Perhaps the gap is simply because conservatives are so heavily armed.

But I also like to think that violence is often not compatible with leftwing projects – which are, after all, about human value and dignity, about principle and repair, about a better future. However foreclosed the possibilities seem, however hopeless the struggle for justice may appear, there remains a possibility for a better world so long as those of us committed to one remain here on earth, struggling. It is our loss that Aaron Bushnell is no longer here to struggle with us.

 Closing summary
It has just gone 5pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Israel-Gaza war coverage here and on the Middle East here.
Here is a recap of the latest developments:

Bombs used in an Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah on Sunday and killed at least 45 people, were made in the US, reported the New York Times (NYT). It cited visual evidence reviewed by the NYT and weapon experts, including “key” details in weapon debris and a unique identifier code that linked weapon fragments, seen in a video, to an aerospace manufacturer based in Colorado.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday hit out at the United Nations and called on the “Islamic world” to react after the latest deadly Israeli strikes in Gaza. “The UN cannot even protect its own staff. What are you waiting for to act? The spirit of the United Nations is dead in Gaza ,” Erdogan told lawmakers from his AKP party. “Israel is not just a threat to Gaza but to all of humanity,” he said, adding: “No state is safe as long as Israel does not follow international law and does not feel bound by international law.”Algeria is circulating a proposed UN security council resolution that would demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and order Israel to halt its military offensive in the southern city of Rafah immediately. The draft resolution, obtained on Tuesday evening by the Associated Press (AP), demands that the ceasefire be respected by all parties. It also calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken during Hamas’s attack in southern Israel on 7 October.The former head of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in a series of secret meetings in which he tried to pressure her into abandoning a war crimes investigation, the Guardian has revealed. Yossi Cohen’s covert contacts with the ICC’s then prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, took place in the years leading up to her decision to open a formal investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in occupied Palestinian territories.The US state department said that it opposes “threats or intimidation” against members of the international criminal court (ICC) in the wake of the Guardian’s reporting on Israel’s secret “war” of surveillance , hacking and threats aimed at sabotaging The Hague’s Israel and Palestine investigation. Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that he had read the report, a joint investigation with the Israel-Palestinian +972 magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, and that the state department was examining the matter. Several members of the international law community have said that Israel’s actions may warrant new indictments.The Biden administration said recent Israeli operations and attacks in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah do not constitute a major ground operation that crosses any US red lines, and that it is also closely monitoring a probe into Sunday’s deadly strike on a tent camp it called “tragic”. Speaking after Israeli tanks were seen near al-Awda mosque, a landmark in central Rafah, national security council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the US was not turning a “blind eye” to the plight of Palestinian civilians.

Rafah residents told Reuters that Israeli tanks mounted raids into Tel al-Sultan in western Rafah and Yibna and near Shaboura in the centre before retreating to positions near the border with Egypt.Israel carried out fresh strikes in Rafah on Wednesday. AFP journalists in Rafah reported new strikes early on Wednesday, hours after witnesses and a Palestinian security source said Israeli tanks had penetrated the heart of the city. “People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones,” resident Abdel Khatib told AFP.Several people were injured on Wednesday morning by Israeli fire in the eastern area of Rafah, Palestinian health officials said. They said some stores of aid were set ablaze in the area.According to Reuters, residents said constant Israeli bombardment overnight destroyed many homes in the area, from where most people have fled after orders by Israel to evacuate. Some residents reported seeing what they described as unmanned robotic armoured vehicles opening fire from machine guns in some parts of the city.The pro-Hamas Shebab news agency, as well as some residents and journalists, reported internet and mobile communications blackouts in some areas of both east and west amid heavy Israeli air and ground bombardment. The Israeli military said it could not confirm the reports.In northern Gaza, Israeli tanks shelled several Gaza City neighbourhoods, and forces thrust deeper in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza’s eight biggest historic refugee camps, with residents saying large residential districts were destroyed by the army.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said they confronted Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, as well as blowing up previously planted explosive devices.The Israeli military said three soldiers had been killed and three others badly wounded in combat in southern Gaza on Wednesday, without elaborating. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan radio said the soldiers were hurt by an explosive device set off in a building in Rafah.The Palestinian health minister said on Wednesday there was no indication from Israel that the Rafah crossing, used to bring in essential humanitarian and medical supplies, could be opened soon. “Since it was closed, we have no indication that the Israelis would like it to be opened any time soon,” the minister, Majed Abu Ramadan, told reporters on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly in Geneva.US aid efforts for Gaza have suffered an embarrassing setback after the temporary pier built by the military broke apart in heavy seas, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. The pier will be pulled out and sent to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, where US Central Command (Centcom) will repair it.Israel’s military was in control of 75% of the Phildelphi corridor, a buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said on Wednesday. He added that he expected fighting in Gaza to continue throughout 2024 at least. “Inside Gaza , the IDF is now in control of 75% of the Philadelphi corridor and I believe it will be in control of it all with time. Together with the Egyptians, we must ensure weapon smuggling is prevented,” he told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.An Israeli airstrike killed three people overnight in Khan Younis, including Salama Baraka, a former senior Hamas police officer, medics and Hamas media said on Wednesday.The Palestinian health ministry said several hospitals in areas where the Israeli army is operating had stopped functioning. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had evacuated its medical teams from its field hospital in the al-Mawasi area, a designated civilian evacuation zone. It cited “the increased threat level from the Israeli occupation, continued artillery and air bombardments in its vicinity, and the complete evacuation of residents from the surrounding area” in its statement.The PRCS said one of its staff, Issam Aqel, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his house in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. It said his death rose to 30 the number of staff killed since 7 October, at least 17 of them killed on duty.Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, met officials from several counties in the Middle East on Wednesday, a day after Spain formally recognised a Palestinian state. “We share with the Arab countries the will and commitment to end violence and make the two-state solution a reality. We trust that recognition will restore hope to the Palestinian people that a future of peace, security and prosperity is possible for the region,” said Sánchez.Spain’s far-right Vox leader came under fire on Wednesday after surprise talks in Jerusalem with Israel’s prime minister to denounce Madrid’s recognition of Palestinian statehood, with the government accusing him of “fuelling war”. The unexpected trip was only publicised on Tuesday night when Santiago Abascal published photos on X of himself and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The meeting took place on the same day that Spain, Ireland and Norway recognised Palestinian statehood. Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares accused Abascal of inflaming the situation. “Abascal is embracing the policy of falsehoods, slander and insults coming from the most extreme elements of Netanyahu’s government,” he told RTVE public television late on Tuesday. “While some people are fuelling wars, others are trying to find solutions for peace.”US Republican Nikki Haley met with Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant. In a post on X, Gallant thanked Haley for her solidarity and said they had had a “meaningful discussion … about the importance of strong US-Israel ties in the face of our common enemies, led by Iran”.French members of parliament on the left have questioned the decision to suspend a lawmaker for two weeks after he held up a Palestinian flag during a parliamentary debate. Sébastien Delogu, a member of parliament for Marseille for the leftwing La France Insoumise party, stood up with the flag during a heated debate over whether France should recognise Palestinian statehood during questions to the government on Tuesday afternoon.Three police officers were injured and 40 people arrested during a protest in Westminster on Tuesday night, Scotland Yard said. One officer was left with a serious facial injury after she was hit by a bottle thrown from the crowd, while two officers had minor injuries. Metropolitan police said the suspect who threw the bottle had not been identified but police were investigating. Most of the crowd, which was between 8,000 and 10,000 people, left Whitehall without incident.Discord from last month’s mob attack on pro-Palestinian student activists encamped at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) flared again on Tuesday as academic workers staged a strike on campus protesting UCLA’s response to the violence. Unionised academic researchers, graduate teaching assistants and post-doctoral scholars at UCLA walked off the job over what they regard as unfair labor practices in the university’s handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in recent weeks, organisers said.Tehran’s sea-launched ballistic missile Ghadr has been made available to Yemen’s Houthis, reported Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency.A flamenco dancer of Palestinian heritage whose image was used in an Israeli government video that accused Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, of helping Hamas by recognising the Palestinian state, has said she is shocked but amused to find herself used for propaganda purposes. “Although there’s no such thing as a coincidence, they chose me – a Palestinian,” she said, adding that it showed how “weak and low” the Israeli government was.

 Algeria proposes UN security council resolution demanding Israel halt offensive in Rafah
 Algeria is circulating a proposed UN security council resolution that would demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and order Israel to halt its military offensive in the southern city of Rafah immediately, according to the Associated Press (AP). The draft resolution, obtained on Tuesday evening by the AP, also demands that the ceasefire be respected by all parties. It also calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken during Hamas ’s attack in southern Israel on 7 October. Some diplomats said they hoped for a quick vote, even as early as Wednesday, the AP reports. “It is our hope that it can be done as quickly as possible because life is in the balance,” Chinese ambassador Fu Cong told reporters. US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “We’re waiting to see it and then we’ll react to it.” The US has vetoed multiple resolutions demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. According to the AP, the draft demands compliance with previous security council resolutions that call for the opening of all border crossings and humanitarian access to Gaza’s 2.3 million people who desperately need food and other aid. The AP reports that the proposed resolution says that “the catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip constitutes a threat to regional and international peace and security.” It also expresses grave concern at “famine spreading throughout the Gaza Strip” and the suffering of Palestinians who took refuge in Rafah. The resolution, the AP report, would demand that Israel “immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in Rafah”. The draft condemns what it calls “the indiscriminate targeting of civilians, including women and children, and civilian infrastructure” and reiterates the council’s demand for all parties to comply with international law requiring the protection of civilians. Algeria’s UN ambassador, Amar Bendjam a, who is also the Arab representative on the security council, told reporters after emergency closed council consultations on Tuesday that he would be sending the draft resolution to the 15-member council later in the evening.

Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez has been sharply critical of the spiralling Palestinian death toll, while Israel has been angered by remarks by Sánchez’s top ministers, including his far-left deputy, who said: “Palestine will be free from the river to the sea”.

AFP reports that in Spain, the far-right Vox and the right wing opposition Popular Party (PP) have both slammed Sánchez for recognising Palestinian statehood.

According to Vox, Abascal hailed Israel’s “firmness” in the Gaza war and told Netanyahu that the Spanish premier “was ready to do anything to cover up his own political and economic corruption”.

Abascal said he told Netanyahu “the real reason” for the Palestinian statehood move was Sánchez trying to divert attention from a graft probe into his wife, reports AFP.

“I told the prime minister that the corruption investigation into Begona Gomez was the real reason Sanchez decided to recognise a Palestinian state,” he wrote on X.

His post sparked a backlash with Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares accusing Abascal of inflaming the situation, reports AFP.

“Abascal is embracing the policy of falsehoods, slander and insults coming from the most extreme elements of Netanyahu’s government,” he told RTVE public television late on Tuesday. “While some people are fuelling wars, others are trying to find solutions for peace.”

 Turkey’s president Erdogan says ‘spirit of United Nations dead in Gaza’
 Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday hit out at the United Nations and called on the “Islamic world” to react after the latest deadly Israeli strikes in Gaza, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“The UN cannot even protect its own staff. What are you waiting for to act? The spirit of the United Nations is dead in Gaza,” Erdogan told lawmakers from his AKP party, according to AFP .
Erdogan’s comments came as the UN security council met to discuss a deadly Israeli attack on a displacement camp west of Rafah on Tuesday that killed 21 people, according to a civil defence official in Hamas-run Gaza.

Erdogan also hit out at fellow Muslim-majority countries for failing to take common action over the Israeli strike, reports AFP.

“I have some words to say to the Islamic world: what are you waiting for to take a common decision?” Erdogan, who leads a Muslim-majority country of 85 million people, told lawmakers from his AKP party.

“Israel is not just a threat to Gaza but to all of humanity,” he said.

“No state is safe as long as Israel does not follow international law and does not feel bound by international law,” Erdogan added, repeating an accusation that Israel is committing “genocide” in Gaza.

 No indication from Israel that Rafah crossing could open soon, Palestinian minister says
The Palestinian health minister said on Wednesday there was no indication from Israel that the Rafah crossing, used to bring in essential humanitarian and medical supplies, could be opened soon, reports Reuters.

“Since it was closed, we have no indication that the Israelis would like it to be opened any time soon,” the minister, Majed Abu Ramadan, told reporters on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly in Geneva.

Rafah was a major entry point for humanitarian relief before Israel stepped up its military offensive on the Gaza side of the border earlier this month and seized control of the crossing from the Palestinian side.

 French members of parliament on the left have questioned the decision to suspend a lawmaker for two weeks after he held up a Palestinian flag during a parliamentary debate.
 Sébastien Delogu, a member of parliament for Marseille for the leftwing La France Insoumise party, stood up with the flag during a heated debate over whether France should recognise Palestinian statehood during questions to the government on Tuesday afternoon.

A meeting of parliamentary representatives voted to suspend Delogu for two weeks and cut his parliamentary allowance by half for two months, the heaviest possible sanction.

 Valérie Rabault, a Socialist parliament vice-president, said she found it “deplorable” that a special parliamentary meeting spent an hour deciding Delogu’s sanction when the really serious situation was what was happening in Rafah.

Asked on a visit to Germany on Tuesday if France would recognise Palestinian statehood, president Emmanuel Macron said: “I am totally prepared to recognise a Palestinian state but this recognition must come at a useful moment”.

“I will not do a recognition based on emotion,” he said.

In February, Macron had said that recognising a Palestinian state was no longer “taboo”.

 Israel sends tanks into Rafah on raids amid Gaza-wide offensive
 Israeli tanks conducted a second day of probing attacks across Rafah on Wednesday, after Washington said the assault did not amount to a major ground incursion of the southern Gazan city that US officials had told Israel to avoid, reports Reuters.

According to the news agency, Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday after a night of heavy bombardment, defying an appeal from the international court of justice (ICJ) to end its attack on the city, one of the last places of refuge in Gaza.

The US, Israel’s closest ally, reiterated its opposition to a major Israeli ground offensive in Rafah but said on Tuesday it did not believe such an operation was under way.

Unlike tactics used in Israel’s ground offensive in the rest of Gaza, Rafah residents told Reuters that Israeli tanks mounted raids into Tel al-Sultan in western Rafah and Yibna and near Shaboura in the centre before retreating to positions near the border with Egypt.

The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said they confronted the invading forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, as well as blowing up previously planted explosive devices, reports Reuters.

The Israeli military said three soldiers had been killed and three others badly wounded in combat in southern Gaza on Wednesday, without elaborating. Reuters cites Israel’s public broadcaster Kan radio as saying the soldiers were hurt by an explosive device set off in a building in Rafah.

Palestinian health officials said several people were injured on Wednesday morning by Israeli fire in the eastern area of Rafah, where they also said some stores of aid were set ablaze.

According to Reuters, residents said constant Israeli bombardment overnight destroyed many homes in the area, from where most people have fled after orders by Israel to evacuate.

Some residents reported seeing what they described as unmanned robotic armoured vehicles opening fire from machine guns in some parts of the city.

Reuters reports that the pro-Hamas Shebab news agency, as well as some residents and journalists, reported internet and mobile communications blackouts in some areas of both east and west amid heavy Israeli air and ground bombardment. The Israeli military said it could not confirm the reports.

In northern Gaza, tanks shelled several Gaza City neighbourhoods, and forces thrust deeper in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza’s eight biggest historic refugee camps, with residents saying large residential districts were destroyed by the army.

Sam Jones is Madrid correspondent for the Guardian.

A flamenco dancer of Palestinian heritage whose image was used in an Israeli government video that accused Spain ’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, of helping Hamas by recognising the Palestinian state, has said she is shocked but amused to find herself used for propaganda purposes.

On Sunday, Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, posted a video on X that interspersed the figure of two flamenco dancers with footage of Hamas’s terrorist atrocities on 7 October. Its caption read: “Hamas thanks you for your service, Pedro Sánchez”.

But it has transpired that the female flamenco dancer is a 34-year-old performer called Zeinab Sabbah who was born to Palestinian parents in Syria and who has been living in the Spanish city of Granada since 2013. Sabbah, who has been studying flamenco for the past five years, said the video of her dancing had been shot three years ago and taken from an image bank without her knowledge.

She told the Spanish news agency Efe that while she had been shocked to see herself in the video at first, she had come to see the funny side of Israel using images of a Spain-based Palestinian to attack Spain. “Although there’s no such thing as a coincidence, they chose me – a Palestinian,” she said, adding that it showed how “weak and low” the Israeli government was.

“However annoying I find [the video] is nothing in comparison to what’s happening [in Gaza] and what the people there are living through,” Sabbah told El País.

Bethan McKernan is Jerusalem correspondent for the Guardian.

The US state department has said that it opposes “threats or intimidation” against members of the international criminal court (ICC) in the wake of the Guardian’s reporting on Israel ’s secret “war” of surveillance , hacking and threats aimed at sabotaging The Hague’s Israel and Palestine investigation.

Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that he had read the report, a joint investigation with the Israel-Palestinian +972 magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call and that the state department was examining the matter.
“I don’t want to speak to hypotheticals about what the United States may or may not do,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “But of course we would oppose threats or intimidation against any public official.”

Several members of the international law community have said that Israel’s actions – a nine-year-long campaign in which Israel deployed its intelligence agencies in a bid to derail potential war crimes charges against the country’s political and military leadership – may warrant new indictments.

“It is abundantly clear that many of the examples highlighted in [the] reporting would amount to offences against the administration of justice at the ICC, pursuant to article 70 of the Rome Statute. Such charges should be brought against anyone who has sought to impede, intimidate or corruptly influence the ICC’s officials,” said Matt Cannock, the head of Amnesty International’s centre for international justice in The Hague.

“Where there are reasonable grounds to believe that individuals already indicted by the ICC may have committed such offences, the prosecutor can, indeed should, add these to the list of charges.”

Last Monday, the ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , and defence minister, Yoav Gallant , as well as for senior Hamas officials. The unprecedented decision marks the first time an ICC prosecutor has sought arrest warrants against the leader of a close western ally.

In response to requests for comment, a spokesperson for Israel’s prime minister’s office said: “the questions forwarded to us are replete with many false and unfounded allegations meant to hurt the state of Israel.”

Discord from last month’s mob attack on pro-Palestinian student activists encamped at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) flared again on Tuesday as academic workers staged a strike on campus protesting UCLA’s response to the violence.

Unionised academic researchers, graduate teaching assistants and post-doctoral scholars at UCLA walked off the job over what they regard as unfair labor practices in the university’s handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in recent weeks, organisers said.

They were joined by fellow academic workers at two other University of California campuses – UC Davis near Sacramento, and UC Santa Cruz, where the protest strike began on 20 May.

The strikers are demanding amnesty for grad students and other academic workers who were arrested or face discipline for their involvement in the protests, which union leaders say were peaceful except when counter-demonstrators and other instigators were allowed to provoke unrest.

The state public employee relations board ordered the University of California and the strikers to take part in mediated talks. A representative for the strikers said the parties met once over the weekend.

Three police officers were injured and 40 people arrested during a protest in Westminster on Tuesday night, Scotland Yard said.

One officer was left with a serious facial injury after she was hit by a bottle thrown from the crowd, while two officers had minor injuries.

 Metropolitan police said the suspect who threw the bottle had not been identified but police were investigating.

A protest organised by a coalition of groups, including the Palestine Solidarity Group, began about 6pm and was required to end at 8pm, police said.

Most of the crowd, which was between 8,000 and 10,000 people, left Whitehall without incident.

 Bombs used in Israeli airstrike on Rafah camp were made in US, say NYT
The New York Times (NYT) are reporting that bombs used in an Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah on Sunday and killed at least 45 people, were made in the US.

It cites visual evidence reviewed by the NYT and weapon experts. The NYT write:

Munition debris filmed at the strike location the next day was remnants from a GBU-39, a bomb designed and manufactured in the United States, The Times found. US officials have been pushing Israel to use more of this type of bomb, which they say can reduce civilian casualties.”

 Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician and one of the experts quoted in the NYT piece, identified the weapon on X.

The NYT quotes Ball in highlighting that a “key detail in the weapon debris was the tail actuation system, which controls the fins that guide the GBU-39 to a target”.

Again quoting Ball, the NYT write that “the weapon’s unique bolt pattern and slot where the folding fins are stowed were clearly visible in the debris”.

 US aid to Gaza stalls after temporary pier breaks apart in heavy seas
David Smith is the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief.

 US aid efforts for Gaza have suffered an embarrassing setback after the temporary pier built by the military broke apart in heavy seas, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The $320m pier was intended to provide a crucial supply line for aid deliveries by sea to reach starving Palestinians and alleviate a humanitarian catastrophe. Now the effort is on hold for at least a week.

 Sabrina Singh, the deputy press secretary for the defence department, told reporters that high seas and a north African weather system had caused a section of the pier to break away on Tuesday morning.

The pier will be pulled out and sent to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, where US Central Command (Centcom) will repair it.

“The rebuilding and repairing of the pier will take at least over a week, and, following completion, will need to be re-anchored to the coast of Gaza ,” Singh said.

“Thus, upon completion of the pier repair and reassembly, the intention is to re-anchor the temporary pier to the coast of Gaza and resume humanitarian aid to the people who need it most.”

 Israeli spy chief ‘threatened’ ICC prosecutor over war crimes inquiry
Harry Davies is an investigations correspondent at the Guardian.

The former head of the Mossad, Israel ’s foreign intelligence agency, allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in a series of secret meetings in which he tried to pressure her into abandoning a war crimes investigation, the Guardian can reveal.

 Yossi Cohen ’s covert contacts with the ICC’s then prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, took place in the years leading up to her decision to open a formal investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in occupied Palestinian territories.

That investigation, launched in 2021, culminated last week when Bensouda’s successor , Karim Khan, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over the country’s conduct in its war in Gaza.

The prosecutor’s decision to apply to the ICC’s pre-trial chamber for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, alongside three Hamas leaders, is an outcome Israel’s military and political establishment has long feared.

Cohen’s personal involvement in the operation against the ICC took place when he was the director of the Mossad. His activities were authorised at a high level and justified on the basis the court posed a threat of prosecutions against military personnel, according to a senior Israeli official.

 White House says Israel’s latest actions in Rafah do not cross US red line
The Biden administration has said recent Israeli operations and attacks in Gaza ’s southern city of Rafah do not constitute a major ground operation that crosses any US red lines, and that it is also closely monitoring a probe into Sunday’s deadly strike on a tent camp it called “tragic”.

Speaking after Israeli tanks were seen near al-Awda mosque, a landmark in central Rafah, national security council spokesperson John Kirb y told reporters that the US was not turning a “blind eye” to the plight of Palestinian civilians.

“The Israelis have said this is a tragic mistake,” Kirby said, referring to the airstrike and fire in an area crowded with refugee tents that Gaza health authorities said killed at least 45 people on Sunday.
Asked if there was anything the White House had seen from Sunday – through to the ongoing ground operations this week – that would prompt a US withdrawal of more military assistance, Kirby said “I believe that’s what I’ve been saying here”.

“We’ve also said we don’t want to see a major ground operation in Rafah that would really make it hard for the Israelis to go after Hamas without causing extensive damage and potentially a large number of deaths. We have not seen that yet,” he said, stating that Israel’s operations on Tuesday were mostly in a corridor on the outskirts of Rafah.

 Opening summary
It has gone 9.30am in Gaza and Tel Aviv, welcome to our latest live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis.

Israel has carried out fresh strikes in Rafah on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

AFP journalists in Rafah reported new strikes early Wednesday, hours after witnesses and a Palestinian security source said Israeli tanks had penetrated the heart of the city.

“People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones,” resident Abdel Khatib told AFP.

It comes as the White House says Israel’s operation in Rafah has not crossed a US red line.
“We have not seen them smash into Rafah,” said the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby.

Meanwhile, Algeria has presented a draft resolution to UN security council members calling for an end to Israel’s offensive in Rafah and an “immediate ceasefire,” according to draft text seen by several news agencies.

The UN security council is scheduled to discuss the war again on Wednesday, but it is not clear when a vote on the resolution will take place.

More on that in a moment but first, here is a summary of the latest developments:

Israeli tanks reached the middle of Rafah on Tuesday , Reuters reported, citing witnesses. They also pushed towards western neighbourhoods, taking positions on the Zurub hilltop, after heavy bombardment. Not all Palestinians sheltering there are able to move, and some have decided there is greater danger in moving given fighting continues across much of Gaza and there is little shelter, food, water or sanitation elsewhere. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.Israel’s military has denied striking a tent camp west of Rafah on Tuesday after Gaza health authorities said Israeli tank shelling had killed at least 21 people there, in an area Israel has designated a civilian evacuation zone, Reuters reports. Two days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells on Tuesday hit a cluster of tents in al-Mawasi, a coastal strip Israel designated as an expanded humanitarian zone where it advised civilians in Rafah to go for safety.An investigation by the Guardian has revealed how the former head of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court in a series of secret meetings in which he tried to pressure her into abandoning a war crimes investigation. The investigation, with the Israeli-based magazines +972 and Local Call, can also reveal how Israel has run an almost decade-long secret “war” against the court. The country deployed its intelligence agencies to surveil, hack, pressure, smear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the court’s inquiries.US aid efforts for Gaza have suffered a setback after the temporary pier built by the military broke apart in heavy seas, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. The $320m pier was intended to provide a crucial supply line for aid deliveries by sea to reach starving Palestinians and alleviate a humanitarian catastrophe. Now the effort is on hold for at least a week.Ireland, Spain and Norway have all formally recognised a Palestinian state. The joint decision by two European Union countries plus Norway, a nation with a strong diplomatic tradition in peacemaking, may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, which would deepen Israel’s international isolation.Denmark’s parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.Nikki Haley, the failed Republican presidential nominee, signed Israeli artillery shells with the inscription “Finish Them!” on a Memorial Day visit to Israel. The former South Carolina governor’s graphic display of support came on a trip to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where she was accompanied by Danny Danon, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a noted hawkish member of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party in the Knesset.

14,"Teaching an undergraduate class on democracy at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs this semester has felt urgent and clarifying. In the classroom, we’ve been looking at backsliding and the slow corrosion of democratic norms in so-called democratic countries. Meanwhile, what’s been happening outside the classroom in more than 120 universities around the US and the world tells us a more ominous story about democracy.
For two weeks, we focused on the United States; there were lively discussions on political polarization, January 6 and the threat posed by supporters of Donald Trump, as well as how robust or fragile US democracy currently is. Looking at each democracy involved criticism of the state. In the class on Israel, we examined, among other areas, controversial proposed judicial reforms, as well as the incarceration of Palestinian minors held in administrative detention, as examples where democratic values might be defined as absent.

But before we did that, we talked about the current debates around criticism of Israel; we agreed that what we were doing was not antisemitic. Students go to college to learn broadly and in depth, to debate, engage with intellectual rigor and agree and disagree. Free speech as a pillar of democracy means you are willing to protect that with which you do not agree. And that the world in all its difficulty can be brought into the classroom. And so it was in my class.

Protest movements are never perfect, but this one has mobilized young people around the world

In thinking about these current protests, many have invoked the ones that overtook US campuses decades ago against the war in Vietnam; there are parallels, not least the call for divestment from the defense industry. And there’s a timely historical reminder of that movement: 54 years ago this week, four students involved in the anti-war Vietnam protests were shot dead at Kent State University.
For some, the prevailing atmosphere of an earlier US era seems apposite too: McCarthyism. In a letter to Linda Mills, New York University’s president, Steven Hahn , an NYU professor of history and the author of Illiberal America, says arrests of students reminded him of “the darkest days of McCarthyism, when self-regarding liberals rushed to do the dirty work of the rightwing political police and tormentors who laughed as dissidents were fired, blacklisted, and personally ruined by their one-time ‘colleagues’. You should be ashamed of yourselves.”

What’s clear in this international, student-led movement that continues to defy college and state authorities in the face of arrest and expulsion is that it has also energized many academics in support of their students. The American Iraqi novelist and scholar Sinan Antoon , an associate professor at NYU, arrested on 23 April, told me: “Make no mistake, this is a wake-up call for all citizens: the erosion of citizens’ rights, the surveillance state and the violation of academic freedom. The exceptionality of this country is being challenged. The protests are the best thing to have happened in years. I have never been prouder of my students, their morality, their decency, protesting against the killing of children.”

The students are clear: these are anti-war protests, first and foremost. And they are getting an education unlike any other, not least an awareness of power and state apparatus.

One Columbia professor, who prefers to remain anonymous, reminds me of the post-9/11 atmosphere, when the focus was on Muslim men. “Today,” he says, “the atmosphere is much worse. Yes, Jewish students have to deal with microaggressions, but Muslim students deal with state surveillance, Israeli surveillance.”

For those inside the movement, there was a euphoric acknowledgement of what solidarity looks like when hundreds of academics at Columbia walked out protesting against arrests, and days later, when faculty created a protective circle in the face of the imminent eviction of the encampment. However, for the final year student Noor Shalabi, a Palestinian American, “nothing, not the arrests, nor debates about freedom of speech or antisemitism should distract from the reason for the protests – to demand a stop to the slaughter of innocent civilians. The crux of this is Palestine. I know this story, I have lived with it my whole life, and to get people who aren’t Palestinian to join and commit to this is amazing.”

Professor Mahmood Mamdani, in Columbia’s anthropology department, says that whatever happens, it’s important to recognize two things: “That the students should never have expected quick results, especially regarding divestment, and that they should recognize that they have won. They have put Palestine and the divestment issue not just in front of university committees, but also at the heart of a global student movement.”

Everywhere the protests emerge, however small, there are faculty who want to support their students

In all universities, there are large swathes of faculty who are not involved. At Princeton’s protest, I spoke to Curtis Deutsch, a professor of geoscience and environmental science. “In my department, I would say, it’s as if October 7 never happened. I’ve never heard a single person say a single word about it. Even obliquely. To see people bury their heads in the minutiae of the natural world so deeply that they can’t even recoil at an atrocity that surrounds them is just mind boggling to me. And we’re also citizens of a country that is supporting and funding this violence. You can get people to talk about the moral urgency of climate change at the drop of a hat, right? If you can’t be motivated to get out of your chair when people are being slaughtered, how do you expect to convince the world that they ought to be mobilizing for abstractions like changes in rainfall or heat waves that kill people?”

Protest movements are never perfect , but this one has mobilized young people around the world. According to Clara Mattei, associate professor of economics at the New School for Social Research in New York, there is also a lot of learning going on. “There is an effort to connect Gaza to bigger struggles, the violence of capitalism, for instance. Not only are the students experiencing novel forms of community, they are also aware of what is and isn’t working, politically and economically.”

Not every university administration has been confrontational with the students; at Brown and Rutgers , a different approach has been taken.

And there is already a sense from the retiring professor Rashid Khalidi , who holds the Edward Said chair in modern Arab studies at Columbia, that one day, this protest will be valorized on the university’s website, just as those who protested against the Vietnam war, as he did, are honored today. As was the case then, he believes that students today are the “conscience of the nation”.

Everywhere the protests emerge, however small, there are faculty who want to support their students and who see the protests as being as much about academic freedom as about Gaza. At MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Michel DeGraff is a Haitian professor of linguistics. He recently resigned from the executive committee of the illustrious Linguistic Society of America, where he had unsuccessfully suggested the LSA should urgently make a statement about the use of language to veil propaganda in favor of the killing in Gaza, especially in light of previous statements about the war in Ukraine, racism and gender pronouns. He says: “There is an Orwellian use of language that permeates so much about Palestine and Israel. How can we study language if we don’t look at how language is being used to dehumanize people?”

Learning does not only happen in classrooms. For the last part of my final class on democracy, I gave my students the option to go to Princeton’s sit-in, to listen to the Palestinian lawyer Noura Erakat speak. Only one chose not to, and several wrote to me afterwards to say how glad they were that they had experienced it, that it took them out of their comfort zone.

Among the mistakes being made by those in authority is seeing college students as kids. Students in this movement on the whole are conducting themselves with maturity and grace; they are learning about community and are looking after each other as well as actively educating themselves, including on what it means to be confronted with heavily armed police. You don’t have to agree with everything or anything they are standing for, but if you believe in democracy, surely you believe in their right to stand for it. And in doing so, you are supporting potential democratic leaders of the future.

15,"Afternoon. The independent MP Kylea Tink will lose her seat should a proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries proceed.

The Australian electoral commission has recommended one of the country’s oldest electorates, North Sydney, be abolished in its latest boundary shake-up. Current North Sydney electors would find themselves in either the divisions of Bennelong (Labor), Bradfield (Liberal) or Warringah (independent). The election analyst Ben Raue predicted that the boundary changes also meant a nominal loss of Bennelong for Labor to the Liberals.

In a statement, Tink said she was “disappointed” with the draft decision. “This is a draft proposal and there is now a further process to go through. I will have more to say on this in due course.”

The AEC reviews Australia’s electoral boundaries regularly to ensure projected population changes are taken into account.

The Australian climate wars appear to be back, with Peter Dutton leading the charge. The opposition leader told News Corp he would not support the nationally legislated 2030 emissions reduction target, triggering accusations he would put Australia in breach of the landmark Paris climate agreement. So what’s the play? According to political reporter Amy Remeikis, it has a lot do with “distraction” and an upcoming election.

The Israel-Hamas war threatens to exacerbate tensions within the party, with Keir Starmer under pressure to suspend Apsana Begum, a Labour MP who posed with the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign after it announced it was going to protest outside the Israeli embassy. So far however the Labour leader has stood by his backbencher, and the party has avoided an ugly internal battle.

17,"Rishi Sunak has condemned pro-Palestine protesters who have staged a demonstration outside Keir Starmer’s house.

The demonstrators called on the Labour leader to support an arms embargo on Israel. The group, called Youth Demand, hung a banner outside Starmer’s home that read “Starmer stop the killing” surrounded by red hand prints, and laid rows of children’s shoes at his front door.

The protesters said in a video on X that weapons being manufactured in the UK were being “used to cause genocide”.

The Metropolitan police said three people were arrested on Tuesday under section 42 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, a power designed to “stop the harassment of a person at their home address”.

Sunak, whose home in North Yorkshire was targeted by climate protesters last year, said such incidents would not be tolerated. In a post on X, the prime minister said: “I don’t care what your politics are, no MP should be harassed at their own home.

“We cannot and will not tolerate this.”

James Cleverly, the home secretary, said on X: “This is unacceptable. There is no excuse for harassing and intimidating politicians and their families in their homes.”

The government is under pressure to publish the legal advice it has received on whether Israel is violating international humanitarian law in Gaza. Several Conservative MPs and grandees called on ministers to stop arming Israel after three British aid workers were killed by Israeli airstrikes in the region.

Starmer has urged the government to publish its legal advice. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said arms sales should be halted if there has been a “serious breach” of international law.

In a statement from Youth Demand, Ella Ward, a 21-year-old participant in the demonstration, said: “In normal circumstances it would be seen as crossing a line to show up at someone’s house, but these are not normal circumstances and we can’t continue with business as usual.

“I’m taking action to call on Starmer to commit to stopping the killing.”

The Met deputy assistant commissioner, Ade Adelekan, said: “Politicians and their families should be able to go about their daily lives without feeling threatened or intimidated.

“It’s completely unacceptable for protest to take place in the vicinity of a politician’s home. There are plenty of appropriate places to protest in London, anyone who chooses to target a private home can expect to be dealt with by officers.

18,"Tensions are growing at the University of California where hundreds of police in riot gear have gathered after warning pro-Palestinian protesters to disperse or face arrest, a day after their encampment was violently attacked by masked counter-protesters.

Police began forming lines near the encampment at the Los Angeles campus and ordered the dispersal of more than a thousand people who had gathered in support of the protesters on Wednesday night, warning over loudspeakers that anyone who refused to leave could face arrest.

Students across the US have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for their universities to divest from Israeli companies and those that supply the Israeli military, in some of the biggest demonstrations to roil US campuses since the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 1960s.

In California, a large crowd of students, alumni and neighbors gathered on campus steps outside the barricaded area of tents, sitting as they listened and applauded various speakers and joined in pro-Palestinian chants.

Overhead television cameras showed students in the barricaded area passing around goggles and helmets, as well as setting up medical aid stations. A small group of students holding signs and wearing T-shirts in support of Israel and Jewish people gathered nearby.

The police presence was in stark contrast to the previous night, when some of the worst violence seen since students across the US intensified their protests in support of Gaza unfolded. At least 15 people were injured when a group of counter-protesters attacked the encampment for hours armed with projectiles, fireworks and chemical agents. Video footage of the violence included some counter-protesters yelling pro-Israel comments as pro-Palestinian protesters tried to fight them off.

Students accused police and security guards at the scene of retreating or failing to intervene for hours.

UCLA chancellor Gene Block said in a statement that “a group of instigators” carried out Tuesday night’s attack, but did not provide details about the crowd or why the administration and school police did not act sooner.

Ray Wiliani, who lives near UCLA, said he came to the campus on Wednesday evening to support the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. “We need to take a stand for it,” he said. “Enough is enough.”

Across the US, police began breaking up protests and encampments at universities from Tuesday evening, starting with Columbia University in New York, where protesters had holed up in an academic building.

The involvement of police has drawn criticism from students and faculty, who decried the use of force to break up protests.

“We are on the right side of history,” Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian American historian and professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia, said. “Shame on our leaders, shame on our administrators, for allowing the police on to our campus. The US is part of this war [in Gaza], it’s our taxes, our bombs, our F-15s and Apache helicopters being used to kill Palestinians.”

Police used an armoured vehicle with a bridging mechanism to gain entry to the second floor of the building, arresting dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators. They also removed a protest encampment that the Ivy League school had sought to dismantle for nearly two weeks.

In total 280 people were arrested at Columbia and at nearby City University (Cuny), New York officials said, while further arrests were made on Wednesday evening at the city’s Fordham University.

New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, drew criticism for blaming “outside agitators” on Wednesday for leading the demonstrations and repeatedly citing the presence of a woman on Columbia’s campus whose husband Adams claimed had been “convicted for terrorism”.

The woman, Nahla Al-Arian, was not on Columbia’s campus this week and was not among the protesters who were arrested.

Al-Arian, a retired elementary school teacher, told the Associated Press that Adams misstated both her role in the protests and the facts about her husband, Sami Al-Arian, a prominent Palestinian activist.

In a statement, the group behind the encampment, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, also defended its right “to include people from outside the Ivy League or the ivory tower in this global movement”. “‘Outside agitator’ is a far right smear used to discredit coalition building and anti racism,” the statement added.

Elsewhere, at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, activists clashed with police officers who destroyed their tents early on Wednesday, and police dismantled an encampment at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire just hours after pro-Palestinian demonstrators put up a handful of tents. Officers arrested multiple people, including at least one professor, according to local media reports.

Police in Oregon came on to the campus at Portland State University as school officials sought to end the occupation of the library that started Monday.

In Tucson, police at the University of Arizona fired “non-lethal” chemical weapons at protesters and arrested four people in the early hours of Wednesday, the Arizona Daily Star reported , to break up a protest camp that had been set up on Tuesday. At least one protester was hit with a rubber bullet.

The University of Texas in Dallas confirmed that 17 protesters had been arrested on its campus as of Wednesday evening, after police moved in at the request of university officials.

According to local media, the police operation involved dozens of state troopers in riot gear. The entire encampment was dismantled within about 20 minutes and additional law enforcement remained on the campus until about 6pm.

Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition.

Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting against the war.

19,"The recent Middle East conflict has prompted a wave of pro-Palestine protests in British schools and controversy over the staff response, with pupils being accused of antisemitism and one headteacher describing the Palestinian flag as a ""call to arms"".

Mike Roper, the headteacher of Allerton Grange high school in Leeds, was forced to apologise after he claimed in an assembly that some people saw the flag as a ""symbol of antisemitism"".

Video of the speech was posted online, going viral and prompting a backlash and protests, with extra police having to be posted outside the school.

The assembly was intended, the school said, to address tensions within its multiracial student community caused by the situation in Israel. But instead the speech brought accusations of ""blatant Islamophobia"" and staff being instructed to help students into and out of school safely following the furious response.

Similar disputes have occurred in schools across the UK since the latest deadly violence in Israel and Gaza , with questions raised over why children expressing support for Palestine are being accused of antisemitism and in some cases subjected to disciplinary action.

During a protest at Clapton girls' academy in east London, students sat down and chanted ""free Palestine"", refusing to return to lessons. One student, Mina, said the children had decided to protest after teachers removed posters about the Palestinian struggle from the walls of the schools.
In Manchester, senior leaders at Loreto college decided to close the institution after hearing about a planned protest. About 200 students went on to assemble near the gates waving flags, with members of the public joining the march.

At Allerton Grange it is understood tensions had been bubbling for a number of days before Roper's controversial assembly, with some pupils claiming they had lanyards bearing the Palestinian flag confiscated.

In the two-minute video the headteacher describes speaking to 20 students urging them not to use symbols and flags as some people may see the flag and ""feel threatened and unsafe"". He went on to add: ""That flag is seen as a call to arms and seen as a message of support for antisemitism.""

A statement was later issued in which Roper said he was ""deeply sorry that a particular example I used in that assembly, referring to the Palestinian flag, has caused such upset"" and promised to engage with local councillors and community representatives about the issues raised.

The Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said: ""Imagine being a Palestinian kid at this guy's school, being told your national flag is inherently hateful. Absolutely outrageous.""

The author and Cambridge University academic Priyamvada Gopal also reacted with dismay to the video.She said: ""Young people can be taught about the evils of antisemitism, and they can learn about the Palestinian flag and its importance to a people's struggle for self-determination. We are all capable of holding more than one thought in our head at the same time, and students should not be patronised by pretending otherwise.""

Ilyas Nagdee, a former NUS black students' officer who works on race equality in education, said he had received reports of close to 100 cases of young people facing consequences for speaking up about Palestine. These included being accused of antisemitism, punished, excluded from school, threatened with a report to Prevent anti-radicalisation programme and even being visited by police.

He said: ""At a time when young people are getting politicised and exercising civil action we are seeing some school leaders do their utmost to stymie them and prevent them developing themselves politically.""

Daniel Kebede, a senior vice-president of the National Education Union, said schools should be a safe space that allowed young people to explore difficult subjects. ""What is happening in Israel/Palestine should be a topic that is explored in schools with sensitivity so that young people can generate their own understanding,"" he said.

One teacher, who wanted to remain anonymous, said at her school students had been explicitly banned from distributing material bearing the Palestinian flag and students who had been passing round ""free Palestine"" stickers were humiliated in front of their peers, with the headteacher calling them ""cowards and racists"".

""These blanket bans on any mention of the word 'Palestine' at school seem to be commonplace, and are even being encouraged by some local councils. Evidently, these are deeply racist policies,"" she said.

Alexandra Wright,a senior rabbi at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in St John's Wood, London, said freedom of expression was very important and young people should be allowed to express their views in an educated and nuanced way, adding that it was of supreme importance that young people in schools and universities were educated about the history and the current situation in the Middle East.

She said: ""All forms of antisemitism and Islamophobia should be condemned and young people should be educated to understand the difference between their criticism of policies that belong to particular leadership and governments, on the one hand, and targeting Jews or Muslims who are not citizens of those countries about whom they are protesting, on the other.""

A spokesperson for Na'amod, a Jewish anti-?occupation campaign group, said no student should be disciplined or accused of antisemitism simply for supporting Palestinian freedom or waving a Palestinian flag.

All the schools named were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for Clapton girls' academy said: ""There was a respectful protest at the school where students raised issues related to Palestine. A small number of posters were taken down because students did not request permission to put them up beforehand.""

20,"Far-right groups and organisations accused of being Islamist are among those expected to be included in a list the government will publish in the coming weeks as part of a new definition of extremism.

The communities minister, Michael Gove, named five groups to MPs on Thursday – three Muslim-led and two far-right – which he said would be examined under the new legislation.

However, MPs from the Conservative and opposition side voiced concern that a much wider range of groups could end up on the list in the future. Here are some of movements that could be affected.

 Muslim and pro-Palestinian
Gove used parliamentary privilege to name the Muslim Association of Britain, Cage and Mend as groups that would be assessed.

Cage, which describes itself as an advocacy group for prisoners, is headed by figures including Moazzam Begg, a former Guantánamo Bay detainee. While its work has been described as “vital” by the human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, others have described the group as being an apologist for terrorism.

Mend describes itself as a community-funded organisation aiming to encourage political, civic and social engagement in British Muslim communities, but there have been claims it has links to extremists.

Gove also mentioned the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), which he described as the British affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in 1997, MAB says it evolved from the older Muslim Student Society (MSS) with the aim of providing “a comprehensive programme of spiritual, intellectual and social development firmly rooted in the teachings of Islam”.

A draft version of Gove’s ministerial statement had also named Friends of al-Aqsa and 5Pillars as “divisive forces within Muslim communities”.

Before the government announcement, another group that was mooted in the rightwing press was Palestine Action, which has been conducting direct action protests against Israeli arms manufacturers in the UK, and issued a joint statement this week with Cage that was critical of Gove’s plans.

 The far right
Gove named Patriotic Alternative (PA), which has emerged from the fractured far-right scene and splits in the British National party, and an older but lesser known group, the British National Socialist Movement, as two that would be assessed for inclusion on the list.

PA is led by a digital-savvy younger generation seeking to present themselves as a “white pride” organisation. It blends traditional far-right causes, such as hostility to immigration, with others, such as preserving the countryside and helping the homeless.

It has sought to piggyback on protests against hotels accommodating refugees, including those which led to riots in Liverpool last year.

Founded in 1968, the British National Socialist Movement is described by the counter-extremist organisation Hope Not Hate as one of the few openly Nazi groups still active in the UK. After a period of dormancy, its activities included opening a gym in Manchester last year and seeking to promote a “fitness network”.

 Culture wars
While Gove said the new definition would not affect gender-critical campaigners, those with conservative religious beliefs and trans activists, MPs who fear such groups could ultimately end up subject to the definition disagreed.

The Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry mentioned the LGB Alliance, a charity other MPs have described as a “hate group” because, she said, it had “raised the hitherto unfashionable but now vindicated concerns” about the prescription of puberty blockers.

The charity was founded in October 2019 by two veteran lesbian activists to campaign for the rights of same-sex attracted people.

Judges ruled last year that Mermaids – a charity that supports transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse children and their families – could not challenge the LGB Alliance’s charitable status.

 Environmentalism and the left
Just Stop Oil has become a bete noire for many MPs, with its direct action targeting major public events and political gatherings.

Greenpeace, whose activists scaled Rishi Sunak’s North Yorkshire home last year in protest against the government’s decision to expand North Sea oil drilling, said this week that government attempts to capture more groups in its official definition of extremism risked fuelling the very extremism it claimed to be trying to quell.

Another group that has faced criticism from Conservative MPs in the past is Black Lives Matter, a name which appeared as a co-signatory of the statement by Cage and Palestine Action.","From left to far right, which groups could end up on the UK extremism list?",The Guardian (London),"March 14, 2024 Thursday 4:16 PM GMT",0.2991984,0.6635506,0.03725102,palestine_guardian1

The fallout from the federal budget continued on Wednesday, with the Coalition assuring voters it would pass the $300 energy rebate despite concerns it was not means tested. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, also signalled a fight on the Future Made in Australia plan , railing against a plan for $13.7bn in production tax incentives for green hydrogen and processed critical minerals as a “handout to billionaires”.

Elsewhere, the Biodiversity Council, an independent science organisation , said the budget was “one of the worst in recent years” for new environment spending. Suicide Prevention Australia said in a statement that the budget “signals a step backward for suicide prevention efforts in Australia”, while the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, criticised the budget as “doing nothing about unlimited rent rises”.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has praised the budget , though few seemed as supportive as Australia’s FM radio hosts , with whom Anthony Albanese spent some of the day.

22,"Efforts to market homes in Israel and “stolen” land in West Bank to Jewish Americans are continuing to spark protests across North America, with the latest angry confrontations happening outside a synagogue in one of Los Angeles’s most prominent Jewish neighborhoods.

The volatile protest and counter-protest outside a real estate event at the Adas Torah synagogue on Sunday prompted denunciations from Democratic politicians, including Joe Biden, who said protests targeting a house of worship were antisemitic and unacceptable.

The Los Angeles demonstration was the latest in a series of heated demonstrations outside similar Israeli real estate events held at synagogues across North America this year, including in Toronto , Canada ; New Jersey ; Baltimore, Maryland ; and North Hollywood.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have accused some of the companies involved in these events of trying to sell stolen land in the West Bank, and questioned the legality of the marketing efforts.

One of the real estate companies named in an advertisement for the Los Angeles event, My Home in Israel, has listed high-end properties for sale in West Bank settlements on its website, including boutique apartments in Ariel and luxury villas in Efrat. Israel’s settlements in the West Bank are widely considered illegal under international law. The US recently restored its position that they are “inconsistent” with international law.

Previous US events involving My Home in Israel have prompted calls for law enforcement investigations from Palestinian American and pro-Palestine groups , and denunciations from some local Jewish residents.
The chaotic demonstration outside a synagogue was quickly condemned by national and state leaders, with Biden, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and local Democratic officials denouncing it an example of “ abhorrent ” antisemitism.

“I’m appalled by the scenes outside of Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles. Intimidating Jewish congregants is dangerous, unconscionable, antisemitic, and un-American,” Biden tweeted.
“There is no excuse for targeting a house of worship,” Newsom tweeted.
Video footage from the protest, which began around noon on Sunday, showed hours of furious and sometimes violent confrontations, first in front of the synagogue, and later elsewhere in the neighborhood. Some local news outlets reported they had seen video footage showing pro-Palestine protesters blocking the entrance to the synagogue, and Rabbi Hertzel Illulian, the founder of a Beverly Hills community center, told the Los Angeles Times that protesters had blocked some visitors from going inside, and that the screaming outside had disturbed afternoon prayers.

Protesters on both sides of the conflict described an out-of-control situation where people were targeted with bear spray and scuffling in the streets, and criticized police for failing to stop the violence.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators shared video of pro-Israel counter-protesters yelling racial slurs , and said that the counter-protesters had punched them, kicked them, chased them, ripped hijabs from the heads of Muslim women, made rape threats and followed some demonstrators back to their cars in an attempt to photograph their license plates.

A pro-Palestine protester who lives in the area said the intensity of the harassment and violence from the pro-Israel counter-protesters was frightening, with “people who came up to me screaming, telling me to get out of their neighborhood”.

Another pro-Palestine protester, a military veteran in his late 30s, blamed the Los Angeles police department for failing to separate the pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters outside the synagogue, as officers typically do at demonstrations. Instead, he said, members of both groups were allowed to mix freely together as police formed a line and tried to push all of the demonstrators away from the synagogue, escalating the conflict between the groups.

That demonstrator said he was pepper-sprayed twice and later forced to go to the emergency room after he was hit in the face with a rock, knocking out two of his teeth.

Sean Beckner-Carmitchel, a Los Angeles journalist who specializes in protest coverage, captured footage of pro-Palestinian protesters “ pleading with officers for help ” as they were “being shoved and hit” by pro-Israel demonstrators with the officers standing by.

Several journalists covering the protest were also assaulted , Adam Rose, the secretary of the Los Angeles Press Club, tweeted on Monday. Among then was Beckner-Carmitchel, who said he filed a police report after being assaulted by pro-Israel demonstrators. A reporter for CalMatters said that one pro-Israel protester knocked his phone out of his hand as he tried to film, and later another demonstrator told him “ you shouldn’t be here ” and snatched away his phone.
A third pro-Palestinian protester in their mid-20s said the lack of police response to these assaults reminded them of the late-night attack in April on the Gaza solidarity student encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, where young pro-Palestinian activists were assaulted for hours by counter-protesters while law enforcement officers stood by. But in some ways, the protester said, Sunday’s violence was more disturbing, because it happened in broad daylight.

The three pro-Palestine protesters, all Los Angeles residents, said they did not want their names published because of concerns that they might be harassed or violently targeted.

The day of chaotic street violence in Los Angeles’ Pico-Roberston neighborhood, home to many synagogues and Jewish schools, struck a nerve with many Jewish Americans, fueling ongoing concerns about antisemitism and the violent targeting of synagogues and other Jewish community centers.

“The events of yesterday have cast a shadow of fear not just in this community or in our city, but regionally and nationally,” Los Angeles’ mayor, Karen Bass, said at a press conference with local Jewish leaders on Monday. Bass said she had directed the police department to provide extra patrols, and said city officials were working to expedite public funding for additional security measures for religious buildings. The interim Los Angeles police chief, Dominic Choi, pledged to work more closely with Jewish public safety groups in the future.

“What we saw yesterday and are witnessing time and again across the nation are protests that devolve into excuses to target and harm Jews,” the Jewish Federation Los Angeles said in a statement on Monday, condemning the “abhorrent violence in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood of Los Angeles, the most densely populated Jewish area on the west coast.”

Code Pink, one of the advocacy groups that had encouraged supporters to demonstrate against the Los Angeles real estate event, said that Biden and other Democratic leaders had “misrepresented this protest as an antisemitic attack on worshippers.

“The protest was solely focused on the illegal sale of Palestinian land. We respect religious practices and make sure our actions are directed toward real estate activities, not against worshippers,” the group said in a statement, criticizing what they called a lack of police intervention as “Zionists attacked peace activists and stole their phones”.

“The demonstration in front of the Adas Torah synagogue over the weekend was in response to the blatant violations of both international law and human rights from agencies that seek to make a profit selling brutally stolen Palestinian land,” the executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Hussam Ayloush, said in a statement. “Elected officials and the mainstream media have politicized this incident as religious discrimination as opposed to a human rights issue.”

“We are horrified that members of our community would use a Jewish place of worship as a location to facilitate Israeli apartheid and the continued ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,” Jewish Voice for Peace LA said in a statement on its Instagram account.

The real estate event at Adas Torah on Sunday had been advertised in the Jewish Journal, a local community newspaper, as a chance to “come and meet representatives of housing projects in all the best Anglo neighborhoods in Israel”.

The Jewish Journal advertisement also mentioned a previous real estate event held on Thursday at the Shaarey Zedek synagogue in North Hollywood, which drew some protesters and a police presence but did not result in any arrests, a Los Angeles police department spokesperson said.

Rabbi Dovid Revah of the Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He told the New York Times that the event was promoting “properties in very established, legal communities”, and said the intensity of the protest showed him “it wasn’t just about Gaza, it was having Jews in Israel altogether”.

Other Jewish leaders across the US have made similar arguments in the wake of synagogue real estate protests.

“This is just a facade and a front for them to bring this antisemitic rhetoric and behavior to a synagogue, and that’s completely unacceptable,” Isaac Schleifer, a Baltimore city council member, said after a demonstration there in April, the Baltimore Jewish Times reported.
My Home in Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protests its event had generated and on its real estate offerings in the West Bank. The company’s website is currently unavailable, and a person who answered a company phone number declined to give their name.

The Los Angeles police department said in a statement on Monday that there “were several physical altercations between the two groups protesting”, and that it had received two reports of battery that were under investigation. Police arrested one individual on Sunday “for having [a] spiked post at a protest”, the department said.

Activists from pro-Palestine groups in Los Angeles held a press conference outside city hall on Tuesday afternoon to criticize the response from law enforcement and local Democratic officials, and to pledge they would not be deterred from further protests.

“We will continue to challenge the sale of stolen Palestinian land in North American cities, no matter where these events take place,” a representative of the Palestinian Youth Movement said.

The Gabba will be demolished in 2025 ahead of a rebuild that will see it become the centrepiece of the Brisbane 2032 Olympics as part of a $2.7 billion project.

Queensland’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, on Friday unveiled the state’s vision for the surrounding precinct, which could be rebranded East Bank, after accepting a project validation report for the iconic stadium.

Demolition work is set to start after the Ashes Test in 2025, 130 years after the Brisbane sporting venue was first established.

Three new pedestrian bridges will be constructed over adjoining roads as part of Queensland’s biggest urban renewal since 1988’s Expo, with retail, dining, housing and open space to also feature.

 Ex-Labor MP sentenced to further 20 years for sexually abusing minors and supplying drugs
Ex-NSW Labor politician Milton Orkopoulos used drugs, money and his position of trust in the community to sexually assault vulnerable young boys.

The now-66-year-old will spend another decade behind bars after being found guilty in April on 26 charges involving sexually abusing and supplying drugs to four minors between 1993 and 2003.

He was sentenced on Friday to a further 20 years in jail for the offences, which include 11 counts of sexual intercourse with a person aged under 16.

Orkopoulos sexually touched the boys, then aged between 10 and 13, and forced them to have anal and oral sex with him, leaving them ashamed, fearful and suffering lifelong psychological impacts.

He is already serving a near 14-year sentence for a string of other sex crimes against young boys, for which he was convicted in 2008. He continues to deny any guilt.

The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (Afca) has welcomed today’s announcement of a scams prevention accord by Australian banks.

Afca’s chief executive officer and chief ombudsman, David Locke, said:

 We have been calling for stronger action and for a consistent approach across the banking sector to prevent scams, and we welcome these positive steps announced today.
 When we talk about scams, we are really talking about serious organised crime, often conducted by international syndicates using sophisticated methods of deception and fraud.
 We are all being required to use digital banking, so the banks must ensure that their products and services are safe and that consumers are protected. Anyone can fall victim to these scams.
Afca is receiving about 1,000 scam cases a month, with 6,048 across the 2022–23 financial year, a 46% increase on the previous year.

In the first quarter of the new 2023–24 financial year, it received 2,856 scam-related complaints, up 57% from 1,819 in the previous three months and 125% higher than the same period a year earlier. The sums lost in these cases can exceed $1 million.

Other initiatives such as greater sharing of real-time intelligence, delays and friction in the banking system to frustrate fraud and restrictions on high-risk transfers, are also welcome, he said.

 ‘Blank cheque’, a licence to print money, or somewhere in between?
Energy ministers are currently meeting in Perth, with the expanded capacity investment scheme high on the agenda (along with perhaps 17 other items).

We discussed some of the outstanding issues of Chris Bowen ’s grand new plan to set auctions up to drive 32 gigawatts of new solar, wind and storage projects into the grid here:

 Related: Chris Bowen’s plan is a shot in the arm for clean energy – but a lot has to go right to avoid future blackouts

Just how state-owned entities (including Snowy Hydro ) will work with or against private firms remains to be seen, as will be the carrots the federal government can lay out to get states like New South Wales to clear planning delays.

Certain media outlets said taxpayers could be up for billions of dollars, while opposition spokesperson Ted O’Brien said Bowen had written a “blank cheque” on the taxpayers’ behalf.

To be fair, the cost is still to be determined, so it is “blank” in that sense. However, the way tenders will work – including setting a ceiling and a floor price – could turn the scheme into an earner for the government.

The ACT pioneered so-called reverse auctions in Australia. The present average price is $86.52 a megawatt-hour, with the average to fall to $81.58/MWh when the Goyder windfarm begins operations in April 2024, the government told Guardian Australia.

During periods of relatively low wholesale power prices, the ACT forks out money. When prices exceed a certain point, they receive revenue.

The latter is the present condition, with the ACT to distribute $68.5m to consumers this fiscal year. A typical household consuming 6,500 kilowatt-hours a year will get a (pre-GST) rebate of about $148. A business customer consuming 25,000 kWh a year can expect a rebate of about $570 (excluding GST).

So, it all hinges on the tender price and the range of the “collar” between the floor and the ceiling.

Developers, though, enjoy more certainty and hence, can raise funds more cheaply and bid at lower prices. (And future governments can’t rip up the deals either.)

 Home affairs minister says Peter Dutton using national security ‘for his own political ends’
The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, has accused Peter Dutton of politicising national security issues including the granting of visas for people in the Israel–Palestine conflict and the apparent arrival of a boat in remote Western Australia, with 12 people in Australian Border Force custody at Truscott airbase.

O’Neil said:

National security is the first priority of our government. As security agencies have repeatedly warned, inflammatory language has a direct link to increased risk of violence. Everyone in our parliament needs to consider the impact that their language will have.

Our government is careful and deliberate about how we discuss national security issues and especially operational matters. No political objective should ever come before the security of our country and the integrity of the operations and agencies that protect us every day.

Whether it’s the conflict in the Middle East, tensions at home, Operation Sovereign Borders or even the highly sensitive security operations involved in individuals returning from conflict, there’s nothing Peter Dutton won’t use for his own political ends.

 Virgin Australia to increase Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet
 Virgin Australia has ordered an extra six Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, on top of eight it was already due to receive, as the airline continues to anchor its growth on fuel efficient fleet.

Virgin made the announcement as it took delivery of its third Max 8 in Brisbane on Friday, with the remaining 11 on order expected next year. Delivery will be staggered at approximately one aircraft per month in 2024.

The new Max 8s will enter domestic and the few short-haul international routes that Virgin has resumed – including Fiji, Bali and Samoa – since its pandemic-induced restructure.

Virgin said the Max 8s will reduce emissions by at least 15% per flight compared to older generation 737s, and will help the airline achieve its 2030 ambition of reducing carbon emissions intensity by 22% and its commitment to targeting net zero emissions by 2050.

The Max 8, which is also significantly quieter than existing 737s, has been the subject of repeated controversies. Manufacturer Boeing is still recovering from the biggest crisis in its history after two deadly crashes forced the grounding of its entire 737 Max fleet.

The crashes were caused by faulty sensors and design flaws, which aviation regulators are now satisfied have been rectified and the aircraft are safe to fly.

 Alistair Hartley, Virgin Australia chief strategy and transformation officer, said: “We are investing in our fleet to best meet our customers’ needs while positioning the business for success in the long-term. A more modern, sustainable, and streamlined fleet is central to our ongoing transformation.”

The investment in a fuel efficient fleet comes ahead of an expectation that private owners Bain Capital will attempt Virgin’s initial public offering – to relist it on the stock exchange – in 2024.

 Most disabled women reluctant to report domestic violence to police, report says
Women living with disabilities are almost twice as likely to experience domestic violence than those without, but most will not seek help.

A report from People with Disability Australia found 57% of women with disabilities had avoided reaching out for support because of negative past experiences when they had their concerns dismissed, faced discrimination or experienced further harm.

Every single woman interviewed did not trust services and authorities, and 71% said they would avoid reporting incidents of family or domestic violence to police in the future.

One interviewee recalled her mother’s experience with family violence, as a woman with a disability.

“My mum actually ended up being institutionalised in a psychiatric institution – she couldn’t access the help that she needed,” she said.

“So that taught me as a young person – what’s the point in reaching out?”

Many respondents said they were scared their children would be taken away if they sought support, such as one woman who uses a wheelchair.

Living with a disability can also be very expensive, so many women who experience financial abuse also avoid seeking help because they do not believe they can support themselves.

 Chalmers acknowledges changes to infrastructure funding 'contentious'
Over in Brisbane, treasurer Jim Chalmers is appearing at the Future Brisbane summit, where he has acknowledged the federal government’s recent changes to priorities in its $120bn infrastructure pipeline are “contentious”.

Earlier this month, infrastructure minister Catherine King announced 50 high-risk infrastructure projects across the country would be defunded with the projected $7bn in savings put toward other “nation-building” projects.

State premiers have strongly criticised the announcement and are expected to raise the issues at the national cabinet meeting in early December.

Chalmers on Friday said it was “contentious” but flagged there’ll be new announcements in the future, depending on what the government “can afford to build”.

Our job is to manage the budget in the most responsible way, to build the best infrastructure we can – as quick as we can. Part of that means being upfront with people about what’s possible.

 Prisoner still on run in north Queensland after two escapees found
A prisoner is still on the run in north Queensland but police have been able to locate two escapees, days after they left a Townsville prison.

Authorities had been searching for Trent Darby Ryan, Daimien Gary Richard Izzard and Dallas Wayne Quakawoot since Wednesday after they could not be located at the low-security Townsville Correctional Centre.

Police said Ryan, 34, and Quakawoot, 22, were located by a dog squad at 2.30am on Friday after the pair abandoned a stolen car in Townsville suburb Railway Estate, about 10km away from the prison.

They were arrested without incident and are back in custody, police said.

They have been charged with escape lawful custody and other property related offences.

The two men are set to appear in Townsville magistrates court on Friday.

However, Izzard, 28, remains at large.

Queensland Correctional Services said Ryan was serving one year and three months for assault occasioning bodily harm while Quakawoot had received four years and three months for armed robbery.

Izzard is serving two and a half years for driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances.

The trio’s escape marked the second in a month at the north Queensland correctional facility after two men fled in late October.

They were arrested and returned to custody within two days.

 Families earning $80k or less could get free childcare
Low-income families could receive free childcare if the federal government accepts the key recommendations of a major report.

The Productivity Commission has been tasked with charting a course towards universal early childhood education and care.

In a set of draft recommendations , it has urged the government to modify childcare subsidies and increase access for children from all backgrounds.

Families would be able to access up to three days of subsidised care a week, regardless of how many hours they worked.

Households with an annual income of $80,000 or less would be eligible for a 100% subsidy.

The changes would cost about $2.5bn a year.

The commission also recommended measures to expand the childcare workforce.

 Bruce Lehrmann denies he was trying to get Brittany Higgins drunk in Canberra pub
 Bruce Lehrmann has apologised for telling the federal court he did not buy Brittany Higgins any drinks after CCTV footage was played showing him handing over a card to buy her two drinks, but he has denied trying to get her drunk.

The former Liberal staffer was asked by Ten’s barrister Matt Collins KC if he was trying to get Higgins drunk after footage of her was played to the court showing she had consumed six spirit-based drinks in a Canberra pub.

Lehrmann could not explain to the court why there is no record of a third credit card he used to buy those drinks. He maintains he only had two cards, but couldn’t reconcile the amount the drinks would have cost compared to what was on his card statements that he gave to the AFP.

Collins asked Lehrmann: “Do you agree that we’ve just seen you and Ms Higgins returning to the courtyard area from the bar area, each of you carrying a spirits-based drink with a vodkas?”

Lehrmann replied: “I can’t recall what type of [drink]” and he said he paid for them with a card “but I can’t explain beyond that”.

Lehrmann denied telling Higgins to “drink that all now” in a clip which showed him pointing to the glass of alcohol on the table.

Collins suggested he told Higgins to finish her drink before they left.

Lehrmann rejected the suggestion by Collins that he had amassed three drinks in front of Higgins and said “all hers, all hers”.

 Gabba to be demolished in 2025
The Queensland government has announced it’s considering renaming a large chunk of the suburb of Woolloongabba as part of plans for an upgrade of the Gabba cricket ground.

Deputy premier and planning minister Stephen Miles announced on Friday the stadium will be knocked down in 2025, as part of a controversial plan for a new venue for the Olympics.

The new stadium will be at the centre of a revitalised residential and commercial precinct, which will include 880 new apartments, three new pedestrian bridges, and expanded retail and dining options.

Miles also raised the idea of renaming the area “East Bank”, similar to South Bank, an inner-city recreational area on the Brisbane River that was converted from an industrial site.

This isn’t just about a stadium upgrade. This is about anchoring an urban renewal project that will see Woolloongabba transformed like South Bank was transformed for Expo 88.

Woolloongabba is an Aboriginal word which translates to “fight talk place”. The urban renewal precinct covers much of Woolloongabba, according to Miles. The Gabba stadium is named after the suburb.

The new Gabba stadium will have better sightlines for spectators, larger concourses, improved change rooms and 50,000 seats, up from 36,000.

“The Woolloongabba redevelopment, along with Cross River Rail and the Brisbane Metro, will anchor a major redevelopment of Woolloongabba to maximise the benefit of public investment and deliver more housing including social and affordable housing, more jobs, and better connectivity,” he says.

We’re going for the best bang-for-buck and giving Queenslanders a new, modern stadium with all the finishes, because it is the best value for money, and it will deliver much more than a stadium.

Community consultation on the priority development area opens today. Design and procurement of the Gabba rebuild will take place next year.

Miles says construction on the new Gabba will finish by 2030, well ahead of the 2032 games.

 Woman accused of love triangle murder plot to be extradited
A former academic accused of being at the centre of an alleged murder plot that left her ex-partner a tetraplegic and her lover with a gunshot wound will be extradited to South Australia.

 Lisa Margaret Lines did not appear in a Brisbane court on Friday when a magistrate agreed to an unopposed extradition application.

The 43-year-old was represented by a duty lawyer who agreed the extradition was by consent, with Lines accepting she is the person on an arrest warrant.

The court heard Lines has no criminal history in Queensland.

The application was to transfer her to South Australia for a court appearance on Monday.

Lines was taken into custody at Brisbane Airport by Queensland homicide detectives on Thursday on her arrival in Australia.

The historian – a respected expert on the Spanish Civil War – was arrested on the island nation of Palau earlier this month.

Documents before Brisbane magistrates court list her address as Xinidian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, occupation as editor and place of birth as Woodville, South Australia.

The arrest relates to a convoluted series of events that began with a violent incident in the Adelaide Hills in October 2017.

She is charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of conspiracy to murder.

 ABC House Committee concerned trust between journalists and sources 'jeopardised' after WA activists charged
The ABC House Committee is concerned trust between ABC journalists and their sources may be “jeopardised”, after reports that footage handed to the police by the national broadcaster “may have helped lay charges” against activists who featured in a Four Corners story.

The statement comes after Disrupt Burrup activists were charged yesterday in relation to a planned protest outside the Perth home of Woodside chief executive Meg O’Neill.
The ABC MEAA House Committee is concerned about reports that ABC footage handed to the police may have helped lay charges against three activists who featured in a Four Corners story. This is the risk media organisations face when handing over raw footage to police. We are concerned this may jeopardise future relationships and trust between ABC journalists and their sources. The ABC MEAA House Committee is also very concerned about the far-reaching laws in WA that undermine journalists’ ability to make necessary promises to people with whom they work.

 Equality advocates divided about delay of NSW ban of ‘gay conversion practices’
A decision to delay the introduction of a NSW ban on so-called gay conversion practices has received mixed responses from equality advocates, AAP reports.

The NSW government had promised to introduce laws to outlaw conversion practices by the end of the year.

But following requests to conduct further consultation with survivors, the government will delay the introduction of a proposed bill until early 2024.

Independent MP Alex Greenwich wrote to the premier, Chris Minns, seeking more time for consultation before the laws were introduced.

“Reform is urgent but needs to be done carefully,” he says.

Any legislation will need the review and support of survivors of these harmful practices. I’m working well with the Minns government on this legislation and other long overdue LGBTQI reforms in my equality bill and it’s my hope and intention we will achieve significant progress early in 2024.

But Equality Australia says it is disappointed by the government’s delay.

“The NSW government must deliver legislation that prevents the psychological damage and trauma that conversion practices cause, in whichever settings they occur,” legal director Ghassan Kassisieh said on Friday.

Minns says his government intends to fulfil the commitment to ban LGBTQ+ conversion practices.

It’s clear though that we need more time and more consultation and I want to get this right.

 ABC makes statement about discontinuation of defamation case brought by Lehrmann
The ABC has published a statement about the discontinuation of the defamation case brought by Bruce Lehrmann against the public broadcaster, saying the ABC notes that a criminal charge of sexual assault against him was dropped.

“On 9 February 2022, the ABC published a National Press Club of Australia address by Brittany Higgins and Grace Tame,” a statement on its website published on Friday said.

Bruce Lehrmann commenced defamation proceedings against the ABC, claiming that the broadcast of the National Press Club of Australia address accused him of sexually assaulting Brittany Higgins. These proceedings were settled on terms satisfactory to Mr Lehrmann and the ABC including discontinuance of the proceedings. The ABC notes that a criminal charge of sexual assault brought against Mr Lehrmann in the ACT was later dropped. The ABC does not suggest that he was guilty of that charge.

The ABC’s case was discontinued out of court on Wednesday before the trial began.

 Queensland gives Star Entertainment a licence suspension reprieve
The Queensland government has given Star Entertainment a reprieve for a licence ban after the firm was found unfit to hold the licences for its casinos in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.

The company was found to have deliberately misled the regulator and failed to adhere to anti-money laundering rules last year.

It was was fined $100m and given until 1 December, 2023 to develop a remediation strategy, or else have both licences suspended for 90 days.

On Friday, attorney general Yvette D’Ath extended the deadline until 31 May, 2024. She says a $200m plan developed by Star had been approved.

“Assessment of progress will inform future decisions about applying the suspensions,” a Queensland government statement says. A 12-month extension has also been given to special manager Nicholas Weeks, who was installed to oversee the operations overhaul at the Gold Coast and Brisbane casinos. Mr Weeks, manager assisting Terri Hamilton and their team will monitor the plan’s implementation while Star “proves its commitment and ability to remediate and return to suitability”.

D’Ath said she could have completely rescinded the suspended licence, but chose to defer it instead “because there is much more work to do”.

If Star fails to comply with the plan it would face further fines of up to $5m.

“Today’s announcement strikes the right balance between making sure The Star operates lawfully, ethically and in a way that enhances integrity, while also prioritising public confidence and local jobs,” the attorney general says. “The government remains committed to casino reform to address the significant failings identified in the Gotterson review and the findings of the many inquiries into casino operations across the country.” Star’s new $3.6bn Queens Wharf casino in Brisbane is expected to open in the first half of 2024.

 Giant red pumpkin sculpture by Japan’s Kusama unveiled on Mornington Peninsula
Australia’s first big polka dot pumpkin by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has been unveiled at Pt. Leo Estate on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, AAP reports.

The three-metre-wide red and black gourd has been installed with a view of the sea, its design a famed example of the globally renowned artist’s work.

“I am very pleased to showcase my work in such a wonderful place,” the artist says in a statement.

“The magical fusion of nature and my work is something special that can only be seen in each location.”

The Pt. Leo Estate features more than 50 sculptures from around the world, with the pumpkin joining a collection of artworks by the likes of KAWS, Jaume Plensa and Australians Inge King and Clement Meadmore.

Born in 1929, Kusama has become one of the world’s most successful artists, influencing her contemporaries Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg during the 1960s.

The dots reference her childhood, when she lived on a small farm and became lost in a field of flowers, which began to speak to her, the flower heads resembling dots that became her globally-recognised motif.

“A polka dot has the form of the sun … a symbol of the energy of the whole world and our living life, and also the form of the moon, which is calm,” she said.

Japan’s food supplies were disrupted during World War II, and the Kusama family’s storehouse was full of pumpkins, which she ate until she was sick of them.

The artist has painted their organic and irregular shapes for years.
A much-loved yellow and black pumpkin sculpture, installed at the end of a pier on Japan’s Naoshima art island, made global headlines when it was washed out to sea during a typhoon in 2021.

The Mornington Peninsula artwork is open to visitors from Saturday.

 Lehrmann tells court he’d had concerns about ACT criminal trial
 Bruce Lehrmann has told the federal court he has “serious concerns” about his criminal trial, which was aborted last year.

Lehrmann said he didn’t pay much attention to the summing up of the criminal case held in the ACT because of those concerns.

In December prosecutors dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of his former colleague Brittany Higgins, saying a retrial would pose an “unacceptable risk” to her health.

Lehrmann maintains his innocence and pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred.

Network Ten’s barrister Matthew Collins KC is continuing his cross-examination of Lehrmann over the events of the day the alleged offence took place in 2019 when he and Higgins worked for Senator Linda Reynolds.

 Justice Michael Lee gave Lehrmann a short break from the witness box after he said his mind went blank and he couldn’t answer questions.

The former Liberal staffer had admitted telling three different stories – including two false accounts – about the reason for his after-hours visit to Parliament House.

“Do you recollect the chief justice [ Lucy McCallum ] relating to the jury questions that were put to you by the Australian Federal Police on the question of whether there was alcohol in your office?” Collins asked.

Lehrmann replied: “Not specifically, no.”

It is day three of his defamation trial against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson in the federal court.

Don’t Dream It’s Over, written by Kiwi frontman Neil Finn and appearing on Crowded House’s 1986 self-titled debut album, was the band’s biggest international hit, making the top 10 in Australian, European and US markets and reaching number one in Canada and New Zealand. More than three decades later the song has topped Billboard’s TV songs chart for October this year, after it was played during an episode of Magnum PI , a remake of the action series that first appeared on American TV in 1980.

After Don’t Dream It’s Over played on NBC on 25 October, it accrued 4.6m official on-demand US streams and 1,000 downloads, according to Billboard. Reignited interest in the song mirrors the surprise success of another 1980s hit gaining a second life thanks to television. Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill, released in 1985, topped the TV songs chart for October 2022, after being played on Netflix’s hit series Stranger Things.

The group, which includes representatives of Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) and Health on the Frontline (HOFL), will include public health and medical specialists, general practitioners, surgeons, nurses and allied health professionals, from around the country.

Public Health Professor, Dr Linda Selvey said part of the reason for their contribution to the protest action was the health risks associated with coal:

Coal is dangerous for human health. Burning fossil fuels is driving climate change and climate change is a health emergency. We need to respond as we would in any emergency, and we are not.

Retired public health professor, Dr Peter Sainsbury, said climate change “exceeds any public health threat” he has seen in his long medical career:

Climate change far exceeds any public health threat that I have seen in my 40 years as a public health doctor. We are running out of time to avert catastrophe. We need to act, in line with the science, immediately.

Both DEA and HOFL said in a statement they support the right to peaceful protest.

 Third day of Network Ten defamation case sees Lehrmann back in witness box
 Bruce Lehrmann returns to the witness box this morning on day three of his defamation trial against Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson in the federal court. The court heard Lehrmann was fired by Senator Linda Reynolds for serious misconduct after a security breach involving confidential documents, as well as the security breach involving an after-hours visit with former colleague Brittany Higgins. Higgins alleges she was raped by Lehrmann on Reynolds’ couch, an accusation Lehrmann denies. Lehrmann’s barrister said in his opening address his client had been publicly maligned as a rapist and he was seeking vindication and compensation. Ten’s barrister Matt Collins KC asked Lehrmann why he described a serious security incident as a “very brief minor incident about security”.

“Do you remember giving that evidence?’’ Collins said on Thursday. “This wasn’t a minor incident about security, was it?” Lehrmann replied: “Well, no.” Collins asked: “Well, why did you choose only yesterday to say it was a very brief, minor incident about security when the true position is it was one of the grounds for your termination for serious misconduct?’’ Lehrmann replied: “Well, I still do not consider it a major security breach”. Lehrmann is yet to face Wilkinson’s silk Sue Chrysanthou.

 Banks to change transaction system in $100m push to beat scammers
Australian banks have joined forces to launch a new Scam-Safe accord, which will include a $100m investment by the industry in a new confirmation of payee system to be rolled out across all Australian banks.

Confirmation of payee will help reduce scams by ensuring people can confirm they are transferring money to the person they intend to. Customers should expect more warnings and delays when paying someone new or increasing payment limits.

With 15.4bn transactions worth $2.5tn occurring every year across the banking sector, the design and build of an industry-wide confirmation of payee system is a major undertaking. Design of the new system will start straight away and it will be built and rolled out over 2024 and 2025.

In addition, the Scam-Safe accord includes a major expansion of intelligence sharing across the sector with all banks acting on scams intelligence from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange by mid-2024, and joining the Fraud Reporting Exchange. This means critical information is shared across the banking sector at speed about scam transactions, improving the chances of preventing scams and recovering stolen funds.

The Australian Banking Association chief executive, Anna Bligh, said:

This Scam-Safe accord is a new offensive in the war on scams. It reflects the banking sector’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding every Australian. It outlines the actions every bank will take to protect Australian consumers and small businesses and to harden the system against scams.

One of the speakers at today’s School Strike for Palestine has told AAP she is attending to use her voice for “the children of Gaza.”

Year 12 student Jaseena said the strike was about solidarity with the students of Gaza unable to attend school:

I want to use my voice for those children in Gaza who are not able to pursue their education and whose basic human rights have been stolen from them.

In a Facebook event listing, organisers urged students to “bring your friends and classmates and show that business as usual can’t continue while there is a genocide being committed in Gaza”.

“We’ll be walking out of school to demand an end to the bombing of Gaza, an end to the siege and an end to the occupation,” the group said.

Speakers at the Sydney Town Hall event will include striking high school students, the National Union of Students education officer and Palestinian and Jewish critics of Israel.

 Out-of-control Perth bushfires show no sign of easing
A bushfire emergency warning has been issued to areas in Wanneroo and Swann, as an out of control fire continues to rage in the area.

Authorities are warning residents bounded by Coogee Road, Bustard Road, Silver Road, Galah Road, Hawkins Road, Trichet Road, High Road, Scott Road, Belgrade Road, Franklin Road, Caporn Street, Pinjar Road, Da Vinci Park and Mornington Drive in Jandabup, Melalecu, Wanneroo and Mariginiup to leave now if the way is clear.

The emergency warning urges residents to act as soon as possible, adding that there is a threat to lives and homes. It comes as authorities warn strong winds and high temperatures mean it could be days before crews bring the fires under control after they ripped through semi-rural properties and threatened other homes on Thursday.

More than 150 firefighters worked through Wednesday night to save homes as the massive blaze forced hundreds of families to leave as embers rained down.

Teams worked on Thursday to assess damage to properties so evacuated residents could be informed, with fears more destroyed homes would be found.

The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, told AAP a huge amount of firefighting resources, including multiple water bombers, were being used to battle the blaze.

“This is a significant fire... this will be a long-running incident and could take some time before the fire is brought under control given the situation we find ourselves in in terms of the wind and high temperatures,” he said.

A number of firefighters have suffered smoke inhalation and minor injuries and one crew was involved in a “burn-over” incident while in a truck.

After peaking at 39C on Thursday, the temperature is set to ease to 35C on Friday and Saturday before rising to 37C on Sunday.

 Burney says she has no regrets about referendum campaign strategy
Burney has continued, saying she has no regrets on how she and the government approached the referendum.

I’m not a person who spends a lot of time looking at the entrails of things.

I’m more interested in going forward … we’ve been on this merry go round before. Sixty-five thousand years is a pretty long time and I don’t think that’s going to stop any time soon.

Burney also said she expected to remain in her portfolio:

I guess there’s a lot of speculation, post-referendum. But if ever anyone thinks that the Aboriginal affairs portfolio was just about the referendum, they are very, very wrong.

 Linda Burney says government still deciding way forward after Indigenous voice loss
The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, has said the government is yet to decide how to best consult with First Nations people after the loss of the Indigenous voice referendum.

Burney was on RN Breakfast earlier and said today’s Closing the Gap meeting, the first since the referendum, would focus on the silver linings from the loss.

She also conceded that a tangible plan likely won’t emerge from the meeting today, with a long-term re-evaluation of Indigenous policy necessary to address Closing the Gap targets:

What we have seen is a group of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people get involved in the political process.

We had 6 million Australians say yes. And the thing that really excited me about the outcome in places like the Tiwi Islands, where … Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people wanted this change. And those votes are really important.

But clearly, we need to pursue that in the long run. Today’s meeting is about helping to frame up where we go but, most importantly, it’s about looking at the issues in Closing the Gap.

 Labor tells students to stay in school
Sticking with the School Strike, education minister Jason Clare has again pleaded with students to remain in class today.

Clearly believing teenagers respond well to being told what to do, Clare told Channel Seven’s Sunrise that children should stay in school if they want to “change the world.”

Education is the most powerful cause for good in this world, that is where you learn.

If you want to protest, do it on the weekend. School is on, we expect them to be there.

Before the School Strike for Palestine planned today in Sydney and Wollongong, independent MP Dai Le says it’s “OK” to miss a day of school.

The western Sydney MP told the Today show young people have the right to express their opinion:

They believe they don’t have a voice at all in our elected representatives.

I think that absolutely they should be at school but children have the right to express their opinions and they’re at an age now where they can have that say.

Missing out on one day of school probably will be OK from my perspective.

 Students prepare to walk out of class to support Palestine
Hundreds of school students are preparing to miss class to show support for Palestine as part of nationwide events, AAP reports.

The organisers of High Schoolers For Palestine are encouraging students to walk out of class across Sydney, Wollongong and Byron Bay to show support for the Palestinian cause.

Year 12 student and rally organiser Eva said attendees had a moral duty to show solidarity for children in Gaza.

“High school students in Gaza right now can’t go to school, can’t get an education,” she saidP.

“The least we can do here in Australia is come out to show our support for an end to the bombing.”

The New South Waleas premier, Chris Minns, and the education minister, Prue Car, told students to stay in class.

“If you want to change the world, get an education,” Minns said this week.

The Sydney rally is one in a series of national student strikes for Palestinians.

More than 1,000 Victorian school students blocked city streets and staged a sit-in at a major shopping centre in Melbourne on Thursday in support of Palestine.

In Adelaide, pupils held a demonstration at Parliament House.

 Calls for urgent royal commission into domestic violence following deaths of four women in SA
A royal commission into domestic violence is “urgently needed” following the deaths of four women in one week in South Australia, AAP reports.

Hundreds of advocates are expected to rally outside Parliament House in Adelaide today after the murder of 55-year-old mother Jodie Jewell by her husband on Tuesday rounded off a horrific seven days for the state.

Domestic violence services peak body Embolden SA co-chair Maria Hagias said a national probe would mean better-targeted funding.

“A royal commission will help our state target much-needed investment where it will have the most impact, across prevention, early intervention, crisis response and recovery.”

New statistics from the AIHW show that more than half of assault injury hospitalisations in 2021–22 involving children under 15, where the perpetrator was specified, were domestic violence-related.

Latrobe University family violence researcher Leesa Hooker said a royal commission examining the issue at a national level would be a “fabulous start”.

“It is a crisis,” Hooker said.

The SA attorney general, Kyam Maher, said the government was looking to pass legislation to crack down on people who breach intervention orders, would review strangulation laws and is conducting consultation on coercive control laws.

 The national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

 Firefighters battle out-of-control blazes in WA
Firefighters continue to battle out-of-control bushfires that have claimed at least 10 homes in metropolitan Perth, Australian Associated Press reports.

Authorities warned on Thursday it could be days before the fires were brought under control after they ripped through semi-rural properties and threatened more homes in up to eight suburbs.

As of 3am today, Western Australia emergency services had an emergency warning in place for four Perth suburbs in the City of Wanneroo and the City of Swan, in Perth’s north-east.

More than 150 firefighters worked through the night to save homes as the massive blaze in the city’s north forced hundreds of families to leave on Wednesday night as embers rained down on their homes.

Teams worked to assess damage to properties so evacuated residents could be informed, with fears more destroyed homes could be found.

More than 1,000 people were left without power as critical infrastructure was brought down in unforgiving temperatures that peaked at 40C, with winds of up to 80km/h fanning the flames.

 Black Friday shopping splurge expected
Australian shoppers are tipped to splurge a record amount in today’s Black Friday sales after a year of sluggish retail spending, Australian Associated Press reports.

The National Retail Association expects there will be up to $6.3bn worth of sales over a four-day period while comparison website Finder predicted a $6.7bn spend.

The association’s director, Rob Godwin, said many brands had brought their discounting strategies forward after a flat start to the festive season.

It is now the nation’s most popular sales event, with a Finder survey of 1,063 people showing up to 9.3 million Australians have already taken part or planned to shop the sales.

The large number of shoppers is partially attributed to people trying to find a way through rising cost of living pressures, Finder head of consumer research Graham Cooke said.

Cooke said the categories shoppers were planning to save on had not necessarily seen the highest price increases.

“Eight out of the top 10 price increases are for food items – so consumers might be better off hunting for discounts in the grocery aisle rather than the clothes shop,” he said.

Black Friday sales are held on the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States and gained traction in Australia in the past decade.

 Welcome
Good morning and welcome to our rolling news blog. I’m Martin Farrer and after I’ve run through a couple of overnight stories and breaking news my colleague Mostafa Rachwani will step up to the plate.

In February, the Productivity Commission was asked what an affordable, accessible, high-quality, universal early education system should look like. Its new report calls for all under-fives to be able to access at least three days of childcare a week regardless of their parents’ work or income – and families earning less than $80,000 should get a universal 90% subsidy rate.

The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, says that the indefinite detainee NZYQ at the heart of the government’s difficulties over its asylum policy could have been deported – but almost all of the facts suggest otherwise. So what’s going on? Our chief political correspondent Paul Karp investigates. The whole issue of illegal migration will get another turbocharge after a group of migrants were detected on a remote beach in Western Australia. Expect some opportunistic questioning from the Coalition.

Still out west, more than 150 firefighters have been battling a massive blaze in the Perth’s northern suburbs overnight after it destroyed 10 homes and forced hundreds of local families to leave as embers rained down on their streets. The state’s emergency commissioner said the blaze was unlikely to be brought under control for days as firefighters were hampered by strong north-easterly winds bringing dry air across the land.

And it’s expected to be another big day on the stand for Bruce Lehrmann in his defamation fight against Channel Ten. We’ll have all the latest developments.",Australia news live: O’Neil accuses Dutton of politicising national security on visas for Israel - Palestine conflict,The Guardian (London),"November 23, 2023 Thursday 7:24 PM GMT",0.4572422,0.488873,0.053884793,palestine_guardian1
24,"At least three arts organisations have pulled out of Sydney festival over a sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy, amid calls for a boycott.

The protests, backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations and assorted artists and academics, are over a $20,000 sponsorship deal to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin's Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company.

So far, the South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and comedian Nazeem Hussain have pulled out of the 2022 festival.

According to a statement released on Wednesday by the Palestinian Justice Movement Sydney, the sponsorship deal was sealed in May, the same month Israeli armed forces l aunched a series of air attacks on Gaza , killing a number of Palestinian civilians.

""Palestine advocates call on all opponents of apartheid to boycott the 2022 Sydney Festival,"" the statement said. ""By partnering with Israel, Sydney festival will ... contribute to the normalisation of an apartheid state.""

We're also calling on festival directors to refuse complicity w Israeli apartheid & resign. pic.twitter.com/AquadkgjdY - Palestine Justice Movement Sydney (@PalestineRising) December 22, 2021

In an open letter published on the Meanjin website on Thursday , a coalition of artists and writers said that they considered the Sydney festival's continued partnership with the Israeli embassy was ""disgraceful"" and accused the festival of ""creating a culturally unsafe environment for Arab artists and audiences who want to be part of the festival but who now cannot, in good conscience, participate as they bear witness to the slaughter, occupation and oppression of Palestinians"".
Naharin has stated on a number of occasions his support in principle for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movements's agenda on human rights for the Palestinian people.

But, responding to request from Brian Eno to cease using his musical works in an Israeli embassy-sponsored Batsheva Dance Company production in Tel Aviv in 2016, the choreographer described such boycotts as ""lazy"" and ""essentially useless"", adding he believed there were more effective ways of helping the Palestinian cause.

In a statement provided to Guardian Australia on Thursday, a festival spokesperson said it would not be terminating its agreement with the Israeli embassy.

""The festival is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring a culturally safe space for all artists, employees and audiences,"" the statement said.

""[The festival] will be reviewing all funding arrangements with embassies and cultural organisations to ensure that any continuance of these partnerships are compatible with maintaining a welcoming and culturally safe environment moving forward.""

In an earlier statement this week, the Sydney festival board said it was unable to support the BDS movement as requested by the coalition (which includes the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) because the festival was a nonprofit, non-political organisation.

One of the co-authors of the Meanjin letter is writer Michael Mohammed Ahmad, who was due to join the festival board later this year and has now rejected the appointment.

The open letter described the festival's position as ""a hollow claim given the Festival is politically aware enough to platform First Nations and 'minority' or 'diverse artists'.
""How is it that the festival can reconcile its commitment to Indigenous solidarity here while legitimising and normalising relations with a settler colonial apartheid state that maintains a system of racism, subjugation and land theft against Palestinians?"" the letter asked.

 This is so incredibly disappointing. The arts, particularly for marginalised peoples are (for the most part), our political platforms. For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least.- ??Prof Anita Heiss (@AnitaHeiss) December 21, 2021

Writer and academic Anita Heiss tweeted: ""For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least.""

A statement from the Israel embassy in Canberra sent to the Guardian on Thursday said:
""Israel has always and will continue to promote cultural exchange and engage in cultural dialogue in numerous countries including Australia.

""Culture is a bridge to coexistence, cooperation and rapprochement and should be left out of the political arena.""

25,"The Metropolitan police are increasing the profile of officers on London’s streets to provide reassurance following the attack by Hamas on Israel.

The Jewish safety charity the Community Security Trust said it had held meetings with the home secretary, Suella Braverman, the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, and senior police officers to ensure measures are taken to protect the Jewish community.

The CST said its priority was the safety of the Jewish community. It said: “The terrorist atrocities in Israel and the seemingly inevitable war ahead makes this a very difficult time for all of us, especially those with family and friends in Israel.

“Here is Britain we know from past experiences that there will be a sharp rise in antisemitism. Because of that we have spent the weekend in detailed conversations with the home secretary, the security minister and numerous senior police officers throughout the UK.”

The Braverman said she had written to police chiefs across the country, urging them to increase patrols and “use all available powers to prevent disorder and distress to our communities”.

“There can be zero tolerance for antisemitism,” she said. “Sadly, we have seen in recent years how events in the Middle East are used as an excuse to stir up hatred against British Jewish communities.

“There is no place for demonstrations, convoys, or flag-waving on British streets that glorifies terrorism or harasses the Jewish community.”

Ahead of a pro-Palestine rally outside the Israeli embassy in London on Monday, communities minister Lee Rowley said protesters should not attempt to glorify Saturday’s attack.

He told Sky News: “You cannot support proscribed organisations like Hamas within the United Kingdom, and if that’s the case then I would expect police to take action accordingly.”

He added: “Ultimately, there is a right to protest, but there is not a right... to glorify terrorism.”

A fringe event on Palestinian rights at the Labour conference began with 30 seconds of silence to reflect on the horrors of recent days. The host, Chris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, said the “horrors and loss of life” in Israel and Gaza called for a “moment for sober reflection”.

He said the event, hosted by the Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East group, and Medical Aid for Palestinians, was organised before Saturday’s attack and said it would be run in a respectful manner.

Elsewhere, graffiti reading “Free Palestine”, which appeared on rail bridges in Golders Green, north-west London, an area that has a prominent Jewish population, was being investigated as a potential hate crime by British Transport police.

In Northern Ireland, the Gael Force Art collective draped a giant Palestinian flag on Black Mountain overlooking Belfast “in solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters” as a rally outside Belfast city hall drew members of Northern Ireland’s Palestinian community as well as representatives from trade unions, Sinn Féin and the small leftwing party People Before Profit.

The Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have organised two vigils to honour and remember the victims, hostages, and the injured in Israel, one in London on Monday and the second in Manchester on Wednesday, with speakers including the chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis.

Mirvis told Sky News: “The first question we are asking people when giving them a call in the UK is, ‘how is everyone in your family?’ Because there certainly isn’t a Jewish family in the UK which hasn’t been affected in one way or another by this.”",Police increase presence on streets of London over Israel -Hamas war,The Guardian (London),"October 9, 2023 Monday 6:26 PM GMT",0.7310597,0.2525606,0.016379796,palestine_guardian1
26,"Hundreds of thousands of people marched through central London in a pro-Palestinian march on Saturday demanding a permanent ceasefire, a day after the exchange of hostages held in Gaza for prisoners held in Israel amid a four-day temporary ceasefire.

Protesters old and young chanted for a ceasefire as they marched down Park Lane to Whitehall, some draped with Palestinian flags, donning keffiyehs and armed with “Free Palestine” signs and olive branches.

Organisers of Saturday’s march, which has drawn hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to London’s streets and elsewhere in the UK since the conflict began, said the temporary truce showed that a permanent ceasefire is possible.

“We welcome the fact that Israeli women and children and Palestinian women and children, who have been held in illegal detention, have been returned to their families,” Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestinian Solidarity campaign, said.

“But without a permanent ceasefire, the message being given by Israel and by governments who do not press them for a permanent ceasefire the message to Palestinians in Gaza is you have a temporary stay of execution.”

More than 13,000 Palestinians are thought to have been killed since Israel launched its offensive after the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 in southern Israel. As diplomats hope to announce plans to extend the four-day temporary ceasefire in Gaza well before it ends, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence team said Israel’s military was already preparing for the restart of hostilities after four days.

“Pausing is something you do for Netflix, for a genocide you end it,” said Sarah, a theatre practitioner in her 30s. “I’m here to platform voices that in the western hemisphere can easily be demonised just because of where these voices are held in the bodies of Arab people.”

“I’m so happy to see the diversity of people here,” she said. “And in solidarity, I’m here to be part of that platform.”

The 1,500 Met police officers on duty this weekend handed out flyers warning demonstrators against the use of racist words and images or celebrating terrorism. Nearby two women were handing out ma’amoul biscuits to demonstrators, in celebration they said, of the freed prisoners.

“The Met supports the right for people to make their voices heard through protest providing it is done lawfully. However, the law also protects people from racist and religious abuse and prohibits the promotion of terrorism,” deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said on Friday. “While the majority of protesters have complied with these rules, a minority have crossed the line.”

One protester was arrested in London near the start of the protest on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, the Met police said. “Officers spotted him carrying a placard with Nazi symbols on it,” police said.

Throughout the march, stretching down Park Lane and on to Whitehall, protesters repeatedly chanted: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” The phrase, which refers to land between the Mediterranean Sea and River Jordan, is often used in support of Palestine, but some say it is widely understood as a demand for the destruction of Israel.

Among the vast crowd was 29-year-old Alaïa, holding a sign saying: “They wanted to erase Palestine from the world, so the whole world became Palestine.”

“It’s like saying that you’re being compassionate and you give someone water for a day just to kill them four days after,” she said, adding that the UK government’s decision not to call for a ceasefire made her feel sick to her stomach.

“Children have been taken away and now they’re grown women and men, and you allow them out for four days before you’re going to rip them away again,” she said.

“It breaks my heart, I feel like I don’t know what to do with myself. We’re expected to go to work and act like everything’s OK,” she added, looking to the nearby Winter Wonderland, noticeably stark in comparison to the swelling demonstrators.

Among those on the march was 67-year-old Roger King, who travelled to London from Birmingham to help see an end to Gaza’s bombardment. When asked about the British government’s response, he called it “disgusting”, adding that the Labour party was not far behind.

“What Israel is doing is totally disproportionate to what Hamas did – which was not right, absolutely not right,” said King, who has attended every march since the conflict began on 7 October, and will continue until it’s resolved.

“This collective punishment that they dish out without any care of killing innocent civilians and children, it’s criminal, and they all ought to go before a court.”",Huge pro- Palestinian London march calls for permanent ceasefire,The Guardian (London),"November 25, 2023 Saturday 4:42 PM GMT",0.26637772,0.57265294,0.16096935,palestine_guardian1

The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, says Israel has definitively barred it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza, where the threat of famine is highest.

“Despite the tragedy unfolding under our watch, the Israeli Authorities informed the UN that they will no longer approve any @Unrwa food convoys to the north,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the agency, said on X. “This is outrageous & makes it intentional to obstruct lifesaving assistance during a man-made famine.”

Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Lazzarini’s statement. The Unrwa spokesperson, Juliette Touma, said the decision had been relayed in a meeting with Israeli military officials on Sunday.

 Shareholders reject Woodside’s climate plan
The voting numbers at Woodside Energy ’s annual general meeting are now in, with more than 58% of votes cast against the company’s climate report. It is by far the strongest protest vote recorded against any of the dozens of listed companies around the world that regularly put climate-related resolutions to shareholders. “Naturally, we’re disappointed but respect the result,” Woodside chair, Richard Goyder, said shortly after the results were announced. Earlier today Goyder was re-elected against a shareholder push to oust him as chair over the company’s climate credentials.
“The board will reflect closely on the result and continue to engage with shareholders as we progress our strategy.” The battle over the climate plan pitched the country’s biggest oil and gas producer against global investors increasingly concerned about the energy sector’s contribution to global heating. The vote on the climate report, which outlines how Woodside will align operations with rising environmental concerns, is non-binding, however the results put pressure on the company to align policies with the views of its shareholders.

 Police believed ‘an attack might ensue’
Counter-terrorism police carried out raids and arrested a group of teenagers who they allege adhere to a “religiously motivated violent extremist ideology”, and who they had been surveilling because investigators feared “an attack might ensue”.

 David Hudson, the NSW police deputy commissioner, said the juveniles – seven of whom were arrested and five of whom are assisting police with inquiries after the Wednesday raids – had been surveilled following the stabbing at a Wakeley church last Monday that was deemed a terrorist incident.

Hudson said:

Their behaviour whilst under that surveillance led us to believe that if they were to commit any act, we would not be able to prevent that. And we believed through the investigation that it was likely that an attack might ensue.

 Seven arrested, five assisting police after Sydney counter-terror raids
Seven juveniles have been arrested following counter-terrorism raids across Sydney and its south-west focussed on individuals allegedly adhering to a “religiously motivated violent extremist ideology”.

Through the raids – which were in response to last Monday’s terrorist incident stabbing at an Assyrian church in Wakeley – police said 13 search warrants were executed in total, leading to the arrest of seven “juveniles” including 15, 16 and 17-year-olds. Five others are assisting police with their inquiries.

Hudson alleged that all of the individuals are known to each other and are “all linked in a common purpose”, but said there was no immediate danger to the community.

On Wednesday afternoon, David Hudson, the NSW police deputy commissioner, said more than 400 members of the joint counter-terrorism team from the state and federal police forces as well as the NSW crime commission were part of the action that began at about 11.15am.

Hudson said:

From that initial (Wakeley) incident, a number of associates were identified that we believe warranted further close attention and investigation. We will allege that these individuals adhere to a religiously motivated violent extremist ideology.
These investigations have been progressing since the incident, the investigations including comprehensive surveillance activities and intensive scrutiny of these individuals.”

 And the band played on … spoons?
Australia’s and New Zealand’s defence forces are once again coming together at Gallipoli – this time to ensure New Zealand’s military band can play on.

The band’s luggage was among thousands of bags lost during last week’s Dubai floods, with embassy staff only able to retrieve one instrument and a handful of dress uniforms ahead of the 25 April dawn service in Turkey.
While 35 of the missing 65 bags were located, only a handful had managed to be sent on to where the Anzac and Chunuk Bair commemorations were taking place, local media reported.

New Zealand media reported the group’s drummer had been practising making the drumbeat with two spoons, while plans were in place for vocalist Lance Corporal Bryony Williams to sing anthems without accompaniment.

Lambie shared a photo of herself wearing face paint and wrote:

 Woodside concedes shareholders likely to vote down climate report
Woodside Energy has suffered a sharp rebuke of its climate credentials after the company conceded it was “unlikely to receive majority support” for its emissions plans at its annual general meeting today.

Woodside chair Richard Goyder told shareholders in Perth:

The board will seriously consider the outcome when reviewing our approach to climate change. We take the shareholder feedback seriously.

The result will represent the strongest protest vote recorded against any of the dozens of listed companies around the world that regularly put climate-related resolutions to shareholders. Climate reports outline how a company plans to align operations with rising environmental concerns. While they are subject to non-binding votes, and therefore don’t automatically trigger a policy change, they are a way for shareholders to express their disapproval, placing pressure on directors to change direction. The voting results will be disclosed shortly.

 Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel says Wakeley stabbing video should not be removed from X, court hears
The bishop who was allegedly stabbed in his Sydney church has written an affidavit for Elon Musk ’s X arguing that the video of his alleged stabbing last week should not be censored as the Australian online safety regulator has ordered, the federal court has heard. X’s legal representative Marcus Hoyne told the federal court in a case management hearing this afternoon that X would need to put on a lot of documents in the case over the eSafety ordered takedown of 65 tweets of the stabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel at a Wakeley church last week.

Hoyne indicated X had obtained an affidavit from the bishop that the footage should be available. He also said the case was “above his paygrade” and X was approaching barrister Bret Walker SC for the case.

 Justice Geoffrey Kennett extended the interim injunction ordering the posts be hidden from view until 5pm 10 May 2024, when the court will hold an injunction hearing.

Counsel for the eSafety commissioner, Christopher Tran, said the current order had not been complied with. Hoyne said there were significant legal issues to do with eSafety’s powers over content overseas to be dealt with:

I’m not dealing with the political or media issues here. I’m just dealing with the legal issues.

 Universities Australia backs calls for government to ease burden of student loans
The peak body for the tertiary sector has backed calls for the federal government to ease the burden of student loans after today’s revelations debts will rise by 4.8% in June.

Ceo of Universities Australia Luke Sheehy said the commonwealth’s recent consideration of changes to Hecs/Help payments was welcome in light of the increase:

Universities are very supportive of the government’s focus on changing the way student repayments are made... we recognise young people are facing increasing cost-of-living pressures and have called for targeted support for students in the May budget.

Help has led to a significant expansion of the university system, and it is essential that we continue to open the door to university for more Australians as our need for graduates grows.

 Westpac among those pushing back expected first RBA rate cut
The slightly higher than expected March quarter inflation rate confirmed Australia is likely to face a gradual - rather than sudden - slowdown in price increases. Much like the US, UK and so on.

Banks that had been tipping the first Reserve Bank interest rate cut to land in September are likely to pare back those expectations. Westpac has become the first, and now expects the first cut to come in the following RBA board meeting in November.

( CBA had forecast rate cuts in the September, November and December RBA meetings that round out 2024. It was also among the more dovish about today’s inflation figures, tipping a 0.7% quarter on quarter result and 3.4% annual paces - versus the 1% and 3.6% actual result.)

 David Bassanese, BetaShares economist, had a slightly more gloomy take, saying “another interest rate rise can no longer be safely ruled out”. Still, he’s “anticipating” at least one RBA rate cut this year, but now “much closer to Christmas than mid-year”.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers, meanwhile, said inflation had “almost halved” since the government took office, but was “still too high”.

The budget next month will focus on easing cost of living pressures, not adding to them.

That won’t be so easy, though.

While energy rebates, childcare and rental assistance have kept some inflation indicators more subdued than they would otherwise have been, that help isn’t neutral. Extra money in the pocket/e-wallet typically gets spent somewhere.

 NSW premier launches review of bail laws related to domestic violence
New South Wales premier Chris Minns has launched an urgent review to determine if the government should reform bail laws related to domestic violence, following the killing of a young mother in regional NSW whose alleged murderer was released on bail on a slew of serious charges in the days before her death.

Childcare worker and mother Molly Ticehurst, 28, was found dead inside her home at Forbes, in central-western NSW, on Monday. Her former partner Daniel Billings, accused of raping and stalking her in the months before the killing, has been charged with her murder.

On Wednesday, Minns said he has instructed the state’s attorney general, Michael Daley, to seek urgent advice from the crown advocate David Kell SC “to determine whether urgent law reform is required in relation to bail laws in state”.

The advice will look at the role of registrars when it comes to bail application matters, particularly on the weekend and in regional communities. It will also relate to decisions made in the lead up to Ticehurst’s death.

Minns said:

The system has clearly let down Molly … The status quo isn’t working.

Minns said he expects to receive the advice back by the end of May.

 NSW police note findings of inquest into death of man shot by police
New South Wales police say it has noted the findings of an inquest into the death of a man who was shot by police three times while experiencing a psychosis and will review the recommendations.

 Todd McKenzie, 40, was suffering from a psychosis when he was shot three times by police in his Taree home in 2019 following a nine-hour siege after police responded to reports he was on the street yelling and holding a knife.

Deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame deemed in her judgement the “police operations which ended Todd’s life was flawed in a number of significant respects.”

Grahame recommended NSW police catch up to other states and require its tactical police officers - which are tasked with responding to high risk incidents - wear body worn cameras. The judgement also recommended a review and audit of police training in responding to mental health incidents every two years.

 Kershaw quizzed on how often encryption legislation is utilised by AFP
Our very own Paul Karp has asked Reece Kershaw about how often “urgent” legislation around encryption has been used – it was introduced more than five years ago.

Karp said that technical assistance requests (voluntary cooperation from tech companies) had been used 66 times in the last financial year, but the compulsory powers (technical assistance notices and technical capability notices) haven’t been used at all by agencies.

So, why ask the tech companies for more cooperation instead of escalating and using the powers that already exist to compel it?
Kershaw responded:

I think you’ll see in this financial year, a 100% increase on that zero! That’s one thing I’ll say.

I don’t want to go into details of that but you know, it goes back to the tech companies – we just want what we currently had as far as that arrangement of them being able to share material and referrals to us that we can act on. So we don’t know what we’d need to request if it goes dark, if you understand what I mean.
Karp: But 100% of zero is zero. So are you actually going to issue a technical assistance notice and technical capability notice?

Kershaw: “What I’m saying is that I’m aware that there has already been one issue recently.”

 Mike Burgess added:

I will use the law if I need to, but I’m asking for their help.

 Asio’s Mike Burgess: end-to-end encryption ‘unaccountable’ without help of tech companies
Let’s go back to the National Press Club, where Asio boss Mike Burgess has been speaking.

He said the purpose of his speech is to urge tech companies to work with them to resolve challenges around end-to-end encryption:

Let me be absolutely clear – I am not calling for an end to end-to-end encryption. I’m not asking for new laws. I’m not asking for new powers. I’m not asking for more resources. I’m not asking the government to do anything. I’m asking for the tech companies to do more.

I’m asking them to give effect to the existing powers, and uphold existing laws. Without their help, in very limited and strictly controlled circumstances, encryption is unaccountable.
He said that Asio is investigating a number of Australians who allegedly belong to a nationalist and racist extremist network, using an encrypted chat to communicate with “offshore extremists”, sharing propaganda and “discussing how to provoke a race war”.

The chat room is encrypted, so Asio’s ability to investigate is seriously compromised.

 Defence questioned about use of Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to manage project
Staying with this morning’s hearing between Defence officials and ANAO officials over how the former is handling nearly $60bn worth of major projects for a moment: we also heard about how one high-profile project’s risks were being monitored by “uncontrolled spreadsheets”.

Australia’s MRH-90 Taipan helicopter fleet has had a bumpy flight over its years in service, and were permanently grounded in September 2023 ahead of schedule after the tragic deaths of four crew members during a training exercise.
As part of its work reviewing Defence’s major projects, the ANAO acting auditor general, Rona Mellor, said it was heartening to see improvements to how officials were managing project risks.

With the exception of one project – the MRH-90 fleet – which is still being monitored using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

Mellor said:

It’s certainly comforting to see the shift from, if you like, the uncontrolled spreadsheets of the past to a more, you know auditors love an orderly system. There’s still disorder in the system, which is what we’re calling out in paragraph 192... [we] look forward to Defence continuing its journey on improvement in this area.

Defence’s deputy secretary, Chris Deeble, noted the use of spreadsheets but said he mandated a “standardised toolset” - that is not Excel - for other projects.

We have done in the past a range of reforms around risk management, there is more to come, and more that needs to be done to improve the way in which that’s applied to projects. And the way in which we assess risk writ large.

 Defence officials defend department against claims of reduced transparency
This morning, Defence officials appeared before a parliamentary inquiry to answer questions about how 20 of its biggest projects, totalling $58.6bn, are faring.

Each year, the Australian national audit office (ANAO) reports on Defence’s major projects and the joint committee of public accounts and audits – parliament’s public administration watchdog – is tasked with scrutinising its findings further and looking for ways to improve the reporting process.

The ANAO delivered its latest report for the 2022-23 financial year in February, which found most projects were being reported accurately and nine out of the 20 experienced some schedule “slippage”.

A major finding, however, was that Defence was aggregating some of its data, which the ANAO said showed there had been a “reduction in transparency”.

In this morning’s hearing, the department’s deputy secretary, Chris Deeble, defended against the ANAO’s claims it was handing fewer details over for its probe.

I wouldn’t interpret, from my perspective, that we’re trying to reduce transparency by reducing the number. Rather we’re trying to focus and provide the reader a better understanding of what those systemic issues are that we’re confronting and how we’re going after, and resolving those across all of our projects.

The acting auditor general, Rona Mellor, disagreed, standing by one of the report’s key findings and noting it looked like a compliance-ticking exercise.

Even in the course of this hearing, lessons have come out that don’t come out through the preparation of the PDSSs [Project Data Summary Sheets]... during the course of the audit, it looked like a compliance exercise, not a genuine lessons learning exercise and throughout the years, you know, 15 years of experience of [ANAO] doing this – and over time the committee making changes to the guidelines to delve into this – we qualified on that basis that transparency was being diminished.

 Golf course on Tasmania’s King Island named best in new ranking
For all our golf enthusiasts out there: a perennial number one golf course in Melbourne has been dethroned by a public access course, less than ten years old and on a small island off Tasmania, as the country’s best.

The Australian Golf Digest’s top 100 list has placed Cape Wickham, on Tasmania’s King Island, in the number one spot this year. The list is released every two years, measuring Australia’s best courses against a set of criteria.

Editor of the list, Steve Keipert, said the dethroning of Royal Melbourne (West) would “shock plenty” but said the course had not lost ground:

It’s as good as ever – it’s just that it’s been outpointed on our measurement criteria by the stunning Cape Wickham.

And it’s also worth noting that we rate Royal Melbourne on its two established layouts. East and West. The composite layout that most of us see for the big sporting events is a cherry-picked blend of both courses, and not a real day-to-day golf course.

As a result, the composite version doesn’t get reviewed; otherwise it would likely be untouchable. So there’s a lot to consider.

A lot to consider, indeed!

 Education and health costs limited inflation’s slide in the March quarter
Blame on the slightly disappointing inflation figures seems to rest with categories such as education, up 5.9% in the quarter alone, and health, up 2.8%.

Rents too advanced 2.1%, lifting the annual increase to 7.8%, or the fastest in 15 years. Blame very low, if not record-low, vacancy rates in many parts of the country.

Perth alone saw rents jump 9.9% from a year ago, ahead of Sydney’s 8.9% increase and 6.8% in Melbourne – while Hobart’s rents eased 0.4%.

Electricity prices are starting to turn lower. They fell 1.7% in the March quarter, reversing a 1.4% rise in the previous three months. From a year earlier, they were 2% higher.

Again, government intervention helped. Since June last year, power prices were up 3.9% well shy of the 17% increase that would have happened without the Energy Bill Relief Fund rebates, the ABS said.

Automotive fuel also fell 1% in the quarter, with the average unleaded petrol price dropping to $1.94 per litre. The 2 cents/litre savings, though, don’t look like lasting, given how renewed Middle East tension has sent fuel prices much higher since the end of March.

Food and non-alcoholic beverages, meanwhile, were 3.8% higher than a year ago, or roughly in line with the overall CPI result.

 Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, said:

Meat and seafood prices fell this quarter as increased supply and discounting led to price drops for beef and veal and lamb and goat. Discounting of fish and other seafood and other meats also contributed to the fall.

However, it’s hard to see those drops extending for long. Farmers were busy destocking six months ago after the driest three months ever recorded by the Bureau of Meteorology ... and that move won’t be repeated for a while.

That’s unless Labor announces reforms to indexation, as were recommended in the University Accord final report.

The Greens deputy leader and education spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said since the party entered office, student debts had risen by more than 16% as a result of high inflation. It’s equivalent to a $4,000 increase to the average debt.

The Albanese government is punishing millions of people with yet another punitive student debt increase on June 1.

Student debt is already locking people out of the housing market, crushing dreams of further study and stopping people from starting a family, and things are only getting worse because of Labor.

Anything less than scrapping indexation in the May budget is a betrayal to students.

 How the new CPI figures will affect Hecs/Help loans
Millions of Australians with student loans will be hit by increases of more than $1,000 in June, new figures show, as calls grow for the commonwealth to act on a growing “debt spiral”. Quarterly figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today, reveal inflation was 3.6% over the year to 31 March, in large part due to a rise in education costs (+5.9%).

The repayment of Hecs/Help loans are tied to indexation, calculated by combining the consumer price index (CPI) numbers for the four quarters to March and dividing the number by the same figure for the previous year.

It places this year’s rate at 4.8%, down from a punitive 7.1% last year but still the second highest rise in more than a decade – and equivalent to a 16% increase since Labor entered office.

It means students with an average debt of $26,494 will have their loans increased by $1,272 when indexed on 1 June, on top of a $1,758 increase last year.

Students with debts of $50,000 will face rises of $2,400, while students with $100,000 loans will be hit with a $4,800 increase.

The federal government has hinted that student loan reform is being looked at in the upcoming budget, but Guardian Australia understands there will be no announcements today.

 Australian dollar’s jump underscores strength of March inflation figures
The March quarter CPI figures send a clear signal that the inflation rate is likely to take time to slow to where the Reserve Bank wants it.

The 3.6% annual rate is well above the 2%-3% rate that the RBA wants it to be. Worse, two of the other inflation gauges, the trimmed mean and weighted median, both remain with a “4” in them. (The latter of the two didn’t budge from the December quarter’s 4.4% reading.)

Goods and services deemed “non-discretionary” rose 4.2% from a year earlier, while “discretionary” ones rose 2.9%.

It’s perhaps little surprise then that investors have been snapping up the Australian dollar, pushing its rate about a quarter of a US cent higher, to 65.2 US cents. (They lifted the bet that an early RBA rate cut is unlikely.)

Stocks took a similar signal, shedding gains of about 0.4% for the day to be basically flat. (Higher borrowing rates hurt company profits, all else equal.)

Anyway, you can also follow on at home or elsewhere:

 Australia's March-quarter CPI rose by 3.6%, more than expected
Australia’s inflation rate fell to 3.6% in the March quarter from a year earlier, a slightly lower fall than expected by economists. On a quarterly basis, the increase was 1%, also more than the market had tipped.

The numbers will likely make it harder for the Reserve Bank to justify a cut in official interest rates in 2024.

 Ryan Park says NSW Health ‘needs to be better’ following landmark class action payout
The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said that NSW Health “needs [to] and will be doing better” when it comes to the treatment of junior doctors.

As we reported earlier in the blog , NSW Health has resolved a landmark $229.8m class action brought on behalf of junior doctors, alleging underpayments. This is the largest underpayment class action outcome in Australian legal history, with more than 20,000 junior doctors across the state eligible to participate.

At a press conference today, a reporter asked Park what is says about the culture within NSW Health that junior doctors were expected to work 16 and 18 hour days and not be paid for it?

Park said from day one as health minister he has been “extremely concerned” about this.

I made it clear to NSW Health that I expected this situation to be resolved. The fact that it was from a former government was not my priority – getting it resolved as quickly as we can has been my priority.

Now it’s taken 12 months. I know we’re still in the … the final stages of the legal proceedings, but I can acknowledge that NSW health needs and will be doing better in relation to this.
Park said issues around culture couldn’t be fixed overnight but said state government had made “significant inroads” over the past 12 months. He noted that stories of junior doctor mistreatment had almost become “like a rite of passage”:

 That’s not the case. And I want to say a junior medical staff, that that’s not on. That’s not the culture I want in NSW Health.

 March quarter CPI result to set tone for RBA, federal budget
Shortly, the ABS will provide arguably the most closely watched set of statistics so far in 2024.

The consumer price index number comes out every month but it’s only the quarterly wrap that the Reserve Bank (and most economists) factor into their models.

Anyway, the headline figure should generally look like things are moving in the right direction – ie, downward – but it’ll be the pace that matters.

In the December quarter, the annual CPI rate was down to 4.1%, or not far from half the pace of a year earlier. Today, we’ll probably see an annual number of about 3.5%.

If the pundits are on the money, the RBA will probably be confident its settings are about right. Its February update pencilled in CPI dropping to 3.3% by June, but it still hadn’t factored in a figure within the target range of 2%-3% until the end of 2025. (The central bank will update its forecasts on 7 May.)

As things stand, financial markets aren’t expecting an RBA rate cut until next February. Today’s statistics could stoke hopes of an earlier move or dash them.

Mortgage holders aren’t the only ones likely to be twitchy. Hecs loan repayment rates will be based on today’s figures and students will be hoping for as low a figure as possible. (Last March’s 7.1% increase is still stinging many.)

 Jim Chalmers, too, will be hoping for a weak CPI figure. That will give the Albanese government more scope to offer help to struggling households without being accused of fuelling inflation. (A higher than expected number will have the opposite effect.)

 Victorian government has no plans to change settings at North Richmond injecting room
 Jacinta Allan said her government has no intention to make changes to the North Richmond injecting room, despite rejecting a recommendation to open a second facility in Melbourne’s CBD.

Asked about a push by residents who live near the North Richmond facility to hold another inquiry into the suitability of the site following the government’s decision yesterday , Allan said there had already been two inquiries, which recommended it continue its work.

We’ve recommitted to that site because we see having a safe, supervised injection facility as part of our programs that support people who use drugs in taking a health-led approach. That is an important part of the range of services that are provided to people who use drugs.

The issues around the history of the establishment of the North Richmond site – that was a very different pathway [than the proposed CBD site]. There was strong community support for the establishment of a facility around North Richmond.

The work that John Ryan provided to the government reaffirmed the importance of this site and that is why, with yesterday’s announcement of our statewide plan, we also announced our ongoing commitment to the site in North Richmond.

 Jacinta Allan says governments across country ‘need to do more’ to address violence against women
Circling back to the press conference being held by Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, who was asked about the death of a woman in Cobram yesterday. A man police believe was known to the woman has been assisting investigators.

Allan said it is difficult for her to “comment in terms of this particular instance or the particular circumstances around that incident where another woman has lost her life”:

 But in the broader context, over the course of this year, we have seen too many women already in 2024 lose their life. They’ve lost their life, either at the hands of a current or former partner, or they’ve lost their life at the hands of a complete stranger, who seemed intent on inflicting harm against women. This has to stop.
This is why, building on the work that we have done as a government already, we have led the nation in the work on preventing family violence. We had a royal commission, we’ve invested billions of dollars – more than any other state and territory and federal government combined. We know as a government we need to do more. Governments around the country need to do more. We need to look at our programs, we need to look at our systems, we need to look at our legal systems, and how we can strengthen the supports for women.

The premier said the attorney general, minister for women and minister for the prevention of family violence are going to report back to cabinet soon with a plan to address these issues, but said the community also had a role to play:

We need all of us to play a role. This is something we all have a responsibility to do. In our daily lives, in our families, in our workplaces. When we’re out socialising, if we see disrespect being shown, we’ve got to call it out. We’ve got to say that it is wrong. Because doing that, you never know, it might just save a life.

 Sydney MP wants Star Casino land turned into affordable housing
Independent Member for Sydney Alex Greenwich has written to the state premier, calling for government-owned land that is currently occupied by Star Casino to be converted into affordable housing.

In the letter he requests the state government investigate converting the land for “mixed social, affordable, transitional, essential worker and private housing, with new social infrastructure including schools”.

Greenwich said current and former inquiries had highlighted “ongoing social, moral, and economic concerns” associated with Star Casino and because recent reforms have impacted its viability, it now “relies heavily on potentially vulnerable punters”.

In a cost-of-living crisis, exploiting this market is both unscrupulous and unsustainable.

Greenwich argued the “social harm from problem gambling creates economic burdens for the state” through homelessness, domestic violence, substance abuse and mental illness.

The Star has over 500 rooms, including many large suites, which could be converted to provide much-needed housing to families, workers, and others in need of a roof over their head.

 Victorian police investigating alleged attempted arson attack at Docklands gelateria
Detectives from the Viper taskforce are appealing for information as they investigate an alleged attempted arson attack at a Docklands gelateria in January.

 Victoria police alleged in a statement that two men forced their way into the Star Crescent businesses around 5am on 17 January, smashing the glass door and pouring accelerant on the floor before attempting to light the liquid.

Police said they believe that, despite numerous attempts, the liquid failed to ignite and the pair ran from the store.

It is alleged they left the area with a third person in a gold Hyunai Sonata sedan with registration plates 1TI1EX. At the time the men were wearing dark coloured clothing and face coverings, police said.

Officers are keen to speak to any witnesses or people with information. They are also wanting to speak with anyone who has information on the whereabouts of the gold Hyundai.

 Police are treating the incident as targeted, however the exact motivation for the attempted fire remains unclear. Detectives are also looking at whether there is a connection between this incident and any other fires in the area.

 Victoria announces $400m for 37 projects to help ‘build communities’ in outer suburbs
The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing more than $400m for 37 projects in growth areas, to be paid for by a key fund that hasn’t been touched in two years.

Allan said the projects, funded by the growth areas infrastructure contribution (GAIC), will help “build communities” in the outer suburbs.

Speaking in South Morang in the state’s northeast, she said:

There’s a whole range of investments that we’re making across these 37 projects that are about supporting our schools, acquiring land to be able to deliver vital emergency services like the CFA and the SES, investing in walking and cycling connections [and] new bus connections.

The GAIC fund was established in 2010 as a way for developers to help pay for infrastructure in outer areas. They pay a one-off fee per hectare of land in the local government areas of Melton and Wyndham in the outer west, Hume, Mitchell and Whittlesea in the city’s north and Casey and Cardinia in the outer south-east.

The fund is administered by the minister for planning and the treasurer. But the government has drawn criticism for not allocating money from the fund in the past two budgets, despite the population boom in the outer suburbs.

The state’s planning minister, Sonia Kilkenny, said today’s announcement was the “biggest one-off investment that we have seen from GAIC” and said she was open to working with developers to improve the fund:

We know that the current system is not the most equitable system nor efficient system and we’re certainly keen to hear from industry about what further improvements we could make.

 New South Wales falling behind on emissions reduction targets
NSW provides annual emissions figures , and the latest batch for 2023 show Australia’s most populated state is tracking further from its 2030 and 2035 reduction goals than a year earlier.

enltrLatest emissions data for 2023 from NSW government shows the state is falling further behind in its emission reduction goals for both 2030 and 2035. https://t.co/e0Ef8lVjZr pic.twitter.com/6ztzcnvSGy

 — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) April 23, 2024

As the government itself concedes, “ NSW is no longer on track for 56% abatement in 2030; the state is now on track for 44%-50% abatement by 2030 ”.

Similarly, for our 2035 target, NSW is now on track for 65%-70% abatement in 2035 compared to 70% suggested by the previous modelling.

Increased demand for electricity has nudged up emissions from that sector (even after the Liddell coal-fired power plant shut a year ago). Agriculture emissions also rose as crop and livestock activity increased, while carbon pollution from the buildings and manufacturing sector also lifted.

As for positive shifts, the take-up of electric vehicles has been faster than expected. The federal safeguard mechanism too should start reducing industrial emissions and there had been “an increased investment in offsets” in the land sector. (The latter will not be seen as a plus in some quarters – if those offsets turn out to be a chimera.)

 Healthcare productivity up 3% due to improvements in quality
Improvements in the quality of healthcare – not reductions in cost, were the big drivers of productivity in the sector – new research from the Productivity Commission has found.

Productivity grew by about 3% per year between 2011-12 and 2017-18, bringing Australia’s healthcare productivity to rank third out of 28 high income countries, the research found.

It’s the first time the quality of healthcare – looking at the outcomes of the system – has been considered in an assessment of productivity, which the commissioner, Catherine de Fontenay, said provided a “much truer picture of its productivity.”

A healthcare system that gets people in and out of hospital quickly and cheaply isn’t much good if those patients aren’t getting better.

Productivity growth was particularly strong for the treatment of cancers, likely due to the introduction of new cancer therapies in the 2010s.

De Fontenay said the growing cost of healthcare was still a concern, with a need to reduce costs without compromising quality as the population ages.

The report recommended that reducing risk factors such as obesity and alcohol consumption would help reduce the workload of the health sector.

 Woodside faces shareholder rebuke to climate plan
 Woodside Energy is bracing for an investor-led backlash of its climate credentials at its annual general meeting in Perth today, after several major shareholders disclosed they would vote against its emissions plans.

Critics have described Woodside’s strategy as overly reliant on offsets and not aligned with Paris climate agreements, even after it revamped its policies before this year’s AGM.

The country’s biggest oil and gas producer has also been criticised for pursuing plans to develop new fields, representing an expansion in fossil fuel production at a time opponents say the sector must rein in emissions.

Two years ago, a thin majority of votes were cast in the oil and gas company’s favour for its climate report.

Some of that support appears to have evaporated, leaving the climate report at risk of being voted down today. If that occurs, it would show Woodside has lost the majority support of shareholders for its climate plans, opening the way for investors to demand radical changes to its emissions plans.

Agitators are also vying to stop the re-election of Richard Goyder as chairman as a protest over his climate leadership.

 Will van de Pol, the chief executive of climate activist group Market Forces, said Woodside was “steaming ahead with dangerous gas growth”.

All investors including super funds need to hold Woodside’s leadership to account over plans to ramp up emissions that would fuel devastating climate impacts.

Woodside has consistently argued that Australia needs new gas developments to protect against an energy shock and to be used as an alternative to coal for electricity generation.

 Daniel Billings has been charged with the domestic violence murder of Ticehurst while he was on bail for rape and stalking charges against her.

Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, the local mayor said Ticehurst knew a lot of families and children through the community because of her job:

My grandchildren actually go to that child care centre, so I had to take them very quickly on Monday morning, because of what happened. I think there’s a lot of families who had to do the same thing. For parents to have to go and tell their little children their carer and child care worker has died is a very big thing.

 Dr Amireh Fakhouri, the lead plaintiff in the class action, said:

Our purpose in bringing this was to ensure junior doctors’ work was properly recognised. This was not about us asking for more money; it was simply about us being paid for the actual hours that we work.

I want to thank all my many colleagues who supported me in this case and especially those senior doctors within our hospitals who stood with us …

 Online content proliferates ‘almost infinitely’ and can never be completely policed: Rowland
 Michelle Rowland said the video of the Wakeley stabbing is the subject of so much attention, compared to other violent content online, because it is classified as “class one material”. She told ABC RN:

Class one depicts real violence. It has a very high degree of impact, [it’s] gratuitous and likely to cause offence to a reasonable person. In this case, the very high degree of impact is reached by virtue of the terrorism designation that has been given to this particular event.

In terms of other graphic content that exists online, Rowland said a review is ongoing into Australia’s classification scheme:

There’s also an inconsistency in the way content is treated in the online world and in the analogue world, as well. This harmonisation is one that’s long overdue. It’s also one that regulators are grappling with and it’s one that we are taking forward as part of not only our classification, but our online safety framework in order to ensure that it is fit for purpose.

Rowland acknowledged that the proliferation of online content is “almost infinite” and said:

 There will never be a time when every piece of content is capable of being recorded or policed. But what we can do as governments and as regulators is ensure that we operate responsibly and collectively to keep people safe.

Inspired by similar protests in the United States, students from Sydney University established a protest on the quad in support of Palestine last night, stating they will remain until the uni cuts ties “with Israeli universities and weapons manufacturers”.

In the US, dozens of students have been arrested at pro-Palestine demonstrations at Yale University and New York University amid similar protests:

The Sydney University protest encampment was established by Students for Palestine. In a statement, organiser Shovan Bhattarai said students were frustrated by the response of the federal government to what is happening in Gaza:

For six months now, we have watched bombs rain down on Gaza. These bombs hit their civilian targets because of the research carried out by universities like Sydney University... Students have a responsibility to stand up and refuse to be complicit in genocide.

Students plan to stay at the encampment until they “get firm commitments from Sydney University that it will cut its ties with Israeli universities and weapons manufacturers”, the statement said.

NSW Greens senator David Shoebridge spoke at the encampment last night and a rally is scheduled for 1.30pm today, the statement said.

 Government to provide $330m to industrial companies to cut emissions
The Albanese government is giving $330m to major industrial companies to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The grants include $93m for an energy efficiency upgrade at the QAL Alumina refinery at Gladstone, $50m for an Abdri cement manufacturing plant in Port Adelaide and $44m for Shoalhaven Starches food manufacturing in Nowra.

They come from the government’s “powering the regions fund”, which was promised to help big polluting industrial sites to meet emissions reduction requirements under the safeguard mechanism climate policy.
The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the funded projects were estimated to cut CO2 annual emissions by 830,000 tonnes - about 0.2% of national carbon pollution. He said the grants would “future-proof Australia’s heavy industries in a decarbonising world”.

 X boss calls independent senator Jacqui Lambie ‘enemy of the people’
After she deleted her X account and spent yesterday criticising its boss, Jacqui Lambie has been called the “enemy of the people of Australia” overnight by Elon Musk.

Musk took a number of swipes at the independent senator overnight, stating that she has “utter contempt for the Australian people” in another tweet.

Separately, Musk claimed: “The Australian people want the truth. X is the only one standing up for their rights.”

In case you missed it: Lambie deleted her X account yesterday and reportedly called on other federal politicians to delete their accounts, telling Sky News:

When you want to lead by example, it has to happen from here, so start switching off X.

Earlier in the day, Lambie had called Musk an “absolute friggin disgrace” who should be jailed for his refusal to take down content from X of the Wakeley church stabbing. You can catch up on the entire saga below:

 Median wait time for social housing more than three years in Sydney, data reveals
The median wait times for social housing is reaching five and a half years in northern NSW, nearly four years in the Illawarra and more than three years in Sydney, new analysis from Homelessness NSW has revealed.

New government data shows progress to reduce the social housing waitlist is stalling. By the end of March, there were 57,401 households on the waitlist across NSW, including 8,657 on the priority waitlist.

An analysis by Homelessness NSW shows median wait times rising to five-and-a-half years (66.5 months) in northern NSW in the first three months of the year.

People in Illawarra can expect to wait nearly four years (45.4 months) and those in greater Sydney more than three years (36.5 months).

Homelessness NSW CEO Dom Rowe said:

The figures are damning. Thousands of people who are unable to find affordable housing in the private rental market face waiting up to a decade for a place to call home.

It means domestic violence survivors are forced to choose between sleeping in a vehicle or returning to a dangerous home. Others are stuck in unsafe and overcrowded accommodation or sleeping on a different couch every night.

The government needs to build 5,000 new social homes each year for the next decade to take NSW’s share of social housing from one in 20, to one in 10 homes.

 Vehicle efficiency standard would prevent 20m tonnes of pollution from entering atmosphere by 2030: Climate Council
The Albanese government’s proposed new vehicle efficiency standard will prevent 20m tonnes of pollution from entering the atmosphere by 2030 if implemented, analysis from the Climate Council has found.

The 20m tonnes is more than than the amount produced in two years from the 5.1m gas-connected homes in Australia. By 2035, the fuel efficiency standard is set to prevent 80m tonnes of pollution from entering the atmosphere, the equivalent of pollution from every gas-connected home for more than nine years.

The Climate Council’s CEO, Amanda McKenzie, said the analysis showed the efficiency standard was “an impressive step in the right direction”.

The standard will bring more efficient vehicles to Australia, putting us on the road to cleaner air and cheaper bills. Our climate and our wallets will benefit once this standard kicks into gear.
With some car manufacturers’ sales responsible for as much pollution as our dirtiest coal mines, delivering the new vehicle efficiency standard will keep them honest and unlock more supply of cleaner cars that are cheaper to run.

The council’s head of policy and advocacy, Dr Jennifer Rayner, added:

We can slash climate pollution from transport by cleaning up our cars. Capping the amount of climate pollution new cars produce is a long-overdue piece of the puzzle in giving Australians access to the same clean, efficient cars millions are already buying overseas.

The council is also urging the government to help continue reducing transport emissions by doing more to promote the use of public and active transport. You can read more about the efficiency standard here:

 Climate groups rally outside Woodside shareholder meeting
Australia’s leading environmental activist groups will be gathering outside the Crown casino in Perth this morning as the country’s leading oil and gas company holds its annual general meeting, AAP reports.

The groups are urging shareholders to vote against the re-election of Richard Goyder AO as Woodside’s chairman and against the passage of Woodside’s climate transition action plan, which the company is putting to shareholders for an advisory vote.

“Woodside chair Richard Goyder says that the energy transition needs time and trust,” said the executive director of the Conservation Council of WA, Jess Beckerling, in a statement. “We say to Woodside: we’re out of time, and you are not trusted.”

The groups are particularly incensed by Woodside’s Burrup hub project on WA’s Burrup Peninsula, which they say would be the Southern Hemisphere’s largest “gas carbon bomb”, with its lifetime climate pollution estimated at more than 13 times Australia’s annual emissions from all sources.

Goyder said in a letter to shareholders last week that Woodside believed that climate change was an urgent global challenge.

We are concerned that some stakeholders’ and investors’ requests to drastically change Woodside’s strategy and investment priorities risk eroding value for all shareholders and contributing to a disorderly energy transition.

 Road deaths surge over past 12 months
Road deaths across Australia have surged in the past 12 months but the solutions that could help reverse this trend remain shrouded in government secrecy, Australian Associated Press reports.

The number of fatal road accidents across the nation jumped by 8.2% year-on-year to the end of March, with 1,286 fatalities, according to the Australian Automobile Association’s report looking at the national road safety strategy.

 NSW had the biggest rise in road deaths over the year, with a 33% increase to 364 fatalities. Victoria had a 13% increase in road toll to 291 deaths, while the Northern Territory had a 21% surge to 45.

The ACT had the steepest drop in road deaths, with a 76% reduction to four fatalities, followed by Tasmania, which recorded a 35% drop to 31.

Despite the overall year-on-year increase, federal, state and territory governments have failed to release crucial data that could inform ways to reduce the road toll , the automobile association said.

The secret data is collected by the states and territories and describes each jurisdiction’s road quality, the causes of fatality crashes and the effectiveness of law enforcement regimes.

A lack of government transparency means three of the road strategy’s five benchmarks cannot be measured and best practices cannot be compared.

 Immigration points system 'not best way to identify applicants'
The Albanese government has released a discussion paper on how to reform the points system, which determines the makeup of about two-thirds of Australia’s permanent skilled migrants.

The migration review, by Martin Parkinson, Joanna Howe and John Azarias, found it was “not designed to identify applicants with the best potential to contribute to Australia over the long term”.

It called to reform the test by:
focusing on characteristics that are associated with migrants successfully finding skilled work; better targeting the skills Australia needs now and in the future; giving applicants a realistic sense of the likely success of their application and not drive ‘permanent temporariness’; andrecognising that younger migrants will spend more years contributing to Australian workplaces; and better recognising the potential contributions to Australia from partners.

The government will take submissions until 24 May on how the points test could be changed to improve living standards and create a system that is efficient and fair towards the migrants.

The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said:

The migration system we inherited was completely broken, and our goal is to build a smaller, better planned, more strategic migration system that works for Australia.

We are significantly reducing migration levels – we are in the middle of the biggest drop in migration numbers in Australia’s history, outside of war or pandemic.

At the same time, we’re focused on making sure that a smaller migration program is bringing in people who have the skills we need to build Australia’s future. That’s where the points test really matters.

 Welcome
Good morning and welcome again to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be running through some of the top overnight stories before my colleague Emily Wind takes the chair.

Our top story today: a secret report into sexism and bullying in the Australian Border Force reaches the shocking conclusion that its marine unit is “not safe for women”. The Australian Human Rights Commission, in a report commissioned by the ABF, revealed that 100% of women in the unit who responded to a survey “witnessed sex discrimination, sexual … and/or sex-based harassment” and 78% had personally experienced that behaviour.
It comes as the federal government looks to reform the points test for skilled migrants, which determines who gets to come to Australia, following a decision to reduce immigration numbers. The current points system is not the best way to vet applicants, the review says. More coming up.

Social media companies must do more to stamp out extremism and assist law enforcement to track criminals, the heads of Australia’s federal police and security agencies have urged. With the government’s stoush with Elon Musk still fresh , Asio’s director general, Mike Burgess, will use a major speech to argue “privacy is important but not absolute”, while the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, believes “there is no absolute right to privacy”.
The two want to tackle tech companies’ use of encryption, which is used to make online communication secret – they warn this is enabling online crime. Burgess says existing federal legislation compelling the targeted unlocking of encrypted messages for investigative purposes is not being heeded by some companies who must “ make encryption accountable ”.",Australia news live: police allege juveniles arrested in Sydney terror raids have ‘religiously motivated violent extremist ideology’,The Guardian (London),"April 23, 2024 Tuesday 9:29 PM GMT",0.5461386,0.4216013,0.032260098,palestine_guardian1
29,"Labour has signed off its election manifesto before its launch next week, despite a decision by Unite not to endorse it.

At the party’s “clause V” meeting on Friday afternoon, the shadow cabinet, union representatives and the national executive committee (NEC) green-lighted the manifesto.

Two people briefed on the meeting said Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, made clear she would not be able to endorse the document. The trade union continues to harbour reservations about Labour’s position on fire and rehire practices, zero-hours contracts and oil and gas licences.

The manifesto was approved by a round of applause, one source said, so there was no opportunity to register formal disagreement. It will be based on the party’s five missions for government announced last year : the economy, the NHS, energy, education and planning reform.

Party pledges include the creation of GB Energy , a publicly owned green power company; 40,000 more NHS appointments a week; and the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers to plug gaps in the workforce.

The document will contain a promise to recognise a Palestinian state as part of a peace process, as the Guardian revealed on Friday.

Keir Starmer confirmed the policy during a campaign visit in north London earlier on Friday. “That needs to be part of the process, it’s very important we have a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel,” he said.

Asked whether this would be in the manifesto, he told the BBC: “It will be.”

Labour’s clause V meeting is highly secretive, with attendees only told its precise location in central London in the morning. The gathering lasted about six and a half hours.

Those entering the building were interrupted by two protests. In the morning, David Lammy was heckled by a demonstrator from the campaign group Green New Deal Rising, who demanded that Labour commit to a green new deal. When the meeting finished, pro-Palestine protesters greeted those leaving the venue.

The clause V meeting takes its name from the fifth clause of the party rulebook, which seeks to ensure members, affiliated organisations and elected representatives are all able to take part in policy formulation.

A Labour spokesperson said: “Today’s meeting has endorsed Labour’s manifesto. On 4 July, the British people will have the chance to vote for change – to stop the chaos, turn the page and start to rebuild our country.”

The manifesto is due to be launched on 13 June. Luke Akehurst, a Labour parliamentary candidate and member of the NEC, said after the meeting in a post on X: “A historic moment attending the clause V meeting today to agree Labour’s manifesto, which will be published next week. Keir expressed hope it will lead to Labour victory and transformation of the country in same way 1945, 1964 and 1997 manifestos did.”

The leftwing campaign group Momentum said it was “deeply disappointed” that Labour had not committed to free school meals or scrapping the two-child benefit cap.

“We need to kick out not just the Tories, but Tory policies too,” a spokesperson said. “Standing alongside child poverty campaigners and friends across the labour movement, we will continue to push for these policies, which represent the essence of real Labour values.”",Labour signs off election manifesto but Unite refuses to endorse it,The Guardian (London),"June 7, 2024 Friday 6:58 PM GMT",0.26109192,0.65111095,0.087797135,palestine_guardian1
30,"The Republican senator Tom Cotton has urged Americans to “take matters into their own hands” when encountering pro-Palestine supporters, an apparent call to vigilantism as Israel’s military strikes in Gaza continued despite global calls for a ceasefire.

Demonstrations on Monday by supporters of Palestine blocked roads in major US cities, including New York and Philadelphia; delayed flights at the bustling Chicago O’Hare and Seattle-Tacoma international airports; and caused traffic congestion on San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge.

Cotton, a Republican, eventually appeared on Fox News and labeled the protesters “criminals”. He also expressed his sympathy for the people whose commutes were interrupted by Monday’s demonstrations, which demanded that the US government drop its military support of Israel.

Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,100 mostly civilians and taking hostages. Israel responded with a ground and air onslaught that has killed more than 30,000 mostly women and children as well as pushed the region to famine.

The far-right senator from Arkansas told the Fox News host Sandra Smith that as far as he was concerned, those who deserved his sympathies were “all those people who are trying to get to work or trying to pick up a kid”.

He also said he “very worried about the diversion of police resources where it needs to be stopping crime in cities like San Francisco, where firefighters are having to go there when they might have calls for fires out”.

He soon went further, arguing that people in his state would inflict bodily violence on the protesters, whom he called “antisemitic” and “pro-Hamas”.

“If something like this happened in Arkansas on a bridge there – let’s just say I think there’d be a lot of very wet criminals that have been tossed overboard, not by law enforcement, but by the people whose road they’re blocking,” Cotton said.

“If they glued their hands to a car or the pavement, well, [it would be] probably pretty painful to have their skin ripped off. But I think that’s the way we’d handle it in Arkansas.”

Cotton said he “would encourage most people anywhere that get stuck behind criminals like this who are trying to block traffic, to take matters in their own hands” and solve the problem without involving police.

It is not the first time Cotton had expressed such sentiments. In a notorious 2020 New York Times op-ed headlined Send In the Troops, the senator likened Black Lives Matter protests to a rebellion and urged the government to deploy the US military against demonstrators by invoking the Insurrection Act.

“The Insurrection Act authorizes the president to employ the military ‘or any other means’ in ‘cases of insurrection, or obstruction to the laws,’” Cotton wrote. “These rioters, if not subdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives. Many poor communities that still bear scars from past upheavals will be set back still further.

“One thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers.”

At the time, supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement were exercising their constitutional rights to assemble and advocate for social justice after a white Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, a Black man, in plain view of a cellphone camera.

Cotton argued in the 2020 piece that “a majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants”. He also falsely claimed that anti-fascist – or “antifa” – members had infiltrated Black Lives Matter marches, meriting a military response.

Mainstream reaction to Cotton’s op-ed was largely negative, forcing the Times to issue a statement saying that the piece did not meet its editorial standards and should not have been published.

31,"Some Democrats rallied to the defense of Joe Biden on Sunday as the president came under increased criticism over his response to pro-Palestinian student protests and his handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

Republicans have seized on Biden’s response to the protests, which have seen more than2,000 people arrested around the country, accusing him of a weak response. But prominent Democrats, including Biden re-election campaign co-chairperson Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, claimed the president “has been very strong about this from the beginning”.

Their support came as campus protests have seen an increasingly aggressive police response. An encampment at the University of Southern California was cleared by police in riot gear on Sunday morning , and a similar effort at the University of California, Los Angeles was shut down by police who reportedly used rubber bullets on Thursday. Scores of protesters were arrested at Columbia University on Tuesday night – a move which New York City’s mayor defended in an interview on Sunday.

Asked on CNN’s State of the Union if Biden could have reacted differently to the protests, which have seen clashes between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters as well as dueling accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, Landrieu said: “The president’s been very clear about this. He’s also been very strong about the need to stamp out antisemitism and Islamophobia. It’s a very difficult time, [there are] very passionate opinions on both sides of this issue.

“The president has been handling it I think very, very well and I think he will continue to do so.”

Thousands of young people have protested at university campuses across the country in recent weeks, criticizing the Biden administration’s continued support of Israel. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and 2 million displaced, since Israel attacked the enclosed strip in response to Hamas terrorist attacks which killed more than 1,100 Israelis.

Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press , Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator, added his voice to Democrats who have voiced approval for police crackdowns on campus sit-ins, saying it is “appropriate for police to step in” when protests turn into “unlawful acts”.

“When they cross a line and when they commit crimes, they should be arrested,” Kelly said.

“That’s the appropriate thing to do.”

Kelly said some of the university protests had “become very violent, and students – especially Jewish students – have the right to feel safe on a campus, and they’ve gotten out of control”.

“Everybody has the right to protest peacefully. But when it turns into unlawful acts – and we’ve seen this in a number of colleges and universities including here in Arizona – it’s appropriate for the police to step in,” he said.

Biden had mostly stayed silent on the unrest at university campuses until he addressed the issue on Thursday.
“Dissent is essential for democracy,” Biden said in an address at the White House. “But dissent must never lead to disorder.”

Biden said some protesters had used “violent” methods.

“Violent protests are not protected. Peaceful protest is,” he said. “There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.”

The president added: “Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation … none of this is a peaceful protest.”

On Sunday, Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, defended how the police have handled protests in the city. About 280 people were arrested at Columbia University and the City University of New York last week.

“When those protests reach the point of violence, we have to ensure that we use a minimum amount of force to terminate what is perceived to be a threat,” Adams told ABC News This Week.
John Fetterman, the Democratic Pennsylvania US senator who is a vocal supporter of Israel, said the protests were “working against peace in the Middle East” and reiterated his backing for the US sending aid to the country.

“I will never support any kind of conditions on Israel during this. And again, I would, I am going to continue to center – Hamas is responsible for all of that again, then,” Fetterman said.

“And now if you’re going to protest on these campuses, or now what, they’re going all across America as well, too. I really want to, can’t forget, that the situation right now could end right now, if Hamas just surrendered.”

Hours after calling in state troopers to break up a quiet, rain-soaked encampment of anti-war protesters, the University of Virginia president, Jim Ryan, issued a public statement calling the episode “upsetting, frightening and sad”.

Ryan had been noticeably absent from the episode itself. His public statement Saturday evening, his first on the matter, came well after the encampment had been raided and the 25 demonstrators who had pitched tents on the patch of grass by the university’s chapel were arrested.

Ryan called it unfortunate that a small group had chosen to break university rules after receiving repeated warnings.

“I sincerely wish it were otherwise, but this repeated and intentional refusal to comply with reasonable rules intended to secure the safety, operations, and rights of the entire university community left us with no other choice than to uphold the neutral application and enforcement of those rules,” he wrote.

Nonetheless, the arrests were criticized by Jamaal Bowman, the New York progressive Democratic congressman who has been critical of Israel.

“I am outraged by the level of police presence called upon nonviolent student protestors on Columbia and CCNY’s campuses. As an educator who has first hand experience with the over-policing of our schools, this is personal to me,” Bowman wrote on X.
“The militarization of college campuses, extensive police presence, and arrest of hundreds of students are in direct opposition to the role of education as a cornerstone of our democracy.”",Democrats rally to Biden’s defense over response to pro- Palestinian student protests,The Guardian (London),"May 5, 2024 Sunday 4:33 PM GMT",0.38816038,0.5377011,0.07413854,palestine_guardian1
32,"As New York’s annual parade in support of Israel worked its way down Fifth Avenue on Sunday, a group of Israeli citizens shouted from the sidelines.

They waved signs demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the Israelis held by Hamas. They chanted “shame” as two rightwing Israeli cabinet ministers, who have defended the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians civilians, passed by.

Above all, the protesters sought to challenge those Americans who regard support for the war in Gaza as a litmus test of loyalty to Israel.

“Some people booed us because they saw the word ‘ceasefire’ even though that’s the best way to bring the hostages home,” said Noa Fort, one of the organisers of the Israelis for Peace protest on Sunday.

A few hours later, the same group led a vigil in Union Square, where they have gathered on many weekends since the 7 October Hamas attack and the resulting Israeli assault on Gaza. The protesters tell anyone who will listen that opposition to the war in Gaza is also support for Israel, or a freer and more equal version of it.

That’s become an increasingly difficult position for the peaceniks who find themselves under attack from all sides, as being both apologists for, and not loyal to, Israel.

On the one side are hardline pro-Israel groups and prominent Jewish American organisations that have given unwavering support to Israel’s months-long bombardment of Gaza with little more than lip service paid to the Palestinians killed. At times they have accused critics of the war of denying Israel the right to defend itself and of antisemitism, and Jewish opponents of failing as Jews.

On the other side are pro-Palestinian protesters who increasingly reject working with Israelis of any political stripe on the grounds that they are Zionists. Some of those protesters also view discussion about the suffering of Israeli captives held by Hamas as cover for justifying the war.

One of the Israeli protesters, who gave her name only as Stav, recently returned to New York after defending trucks carrying aid to Gaza from attacks by Israelis who claim the food and medicine go to sustain Hamas.

“After October 7, I’ve never felt as politically isolated in my life on all sides. It’s not that my views have changed, it’s that the spectrum of collaborators has significantly narrowed,” she said.

Stav said that before the Hamas attack, she worked with an array of US groups pursuing sometimes disparate goals – from seeking to protect Israel’s judicial system from a power grab by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories. She said that differences on some issues were generally not an obstacle to working together on others.

That has changed.

“After October 7, everyone’s become a lot more siloed. There’s a lot more litmus tests to even get to the point where you actually talk about the issue that you want to be collaborating about,” said Stav.

“There’s no place to have a conversation about the actual facts on the ground that takes into account the fact both Israelis and Palestinians are going to continue living between the river and the sea in some constellation, that nobody’s going anywhere. There’s 14 million people there. We’re not going to ethnically cleanse half of them, no matter which half.”

Israelis in the US who oppose the occupation say they are increasingly isolated from pro-Palestinian activists they used to work with, who have shifted toward demands for renunciations of Zionism and Israel, alongside ambiguous chants, such as: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”

Tamar Glezerman, a co-founder of Israelis for Peace whose aunt was killed by Hamas on the Be’eri kibbutz along with about 100 other people, said she welcomes the scale of the protests against the war and the broader spotlight that has thrown on to Israel’s domination of the Palestinians.

But she launched the weekly protest in Union Square to make the voices of her brand of leftwing Israelis heard without needing “to pass purity tests to enter the room”.

“Some tests we won’t be able to pass and they’re also not fair to demand them of Israelis. We’re not going to dismantle the only country where my family lives,” she said.

“I don’t define myself as Zionist or non-Zionist. I did in the past but now it has become empty of meaning. It could mean anything between someone who believes in two states coexisting peacefully to code for Jews who don’t deserve safety or life. I’ve heard it used in all ways.

“So if somebody wants to discuss Zionism with me, I would like for them to define it first. The way that it’s being used now I don’t think is helpful. It’s detrimental, actually. I read around 33% of Palestinians in the West Bank and 62% of Palestinians in Gaza prefer a two-state solution. So are they Zionists?”

The Israeli peaceniks are hemmed in on the other side by support for the war among fellow Israelis, the steadfast support for Israel among US political leaders and the militancy of parts of the Jewish community in the US.

During Sunday’s parade, the Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, joined in chants calling for the military defeat of Hamas. New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, also endorsed the war.

“We don’t want to see any innocent person die but we have to deal with the hate of Hamas and it must be dismantled and destroyed,” he said.

A recent poll found that many American Jews do not share that view. About one-third agreed with the claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza while only 28% said demonstrations in the US against the war are driven, as some hardline pro-Israel groups claim, solely by animus toward the Jewish state.

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, which conducted the poll, said the results reflect “a shift in how American Jewry relates to the current Israeli government and the broader conflict”.

However, that nuance is not often heard from influential Jewish American organisations that claim to speak for the diaspora in the US and are often fervent defenders of Israeli government policies, including the present war.

Glezerman said she understands that “American Jews feel this kinship and this connection” to Israel but notes that many do not understand its complexities or have an overly sentimental view of the country.

There’s no place to have a conversation about the … fact both Israelis and Palestinians are going to continue living between the river and the sea
 Stav, Israeli protester
“That’s why we say we’re Israelis. It’s not because it’s a fun, easy thing to be. It’s because it gives us a mandate to say: ‘So these people in your community are telling you that the only way to support Israel is through blanket support for the military and all these other things.’ And I am here saying, please do not,” she said.

Some of the Israeli protesters have been here before. In 2014, Jewish American organisations rallied in support of Israel’s assault on Gaza known as Operation Protective Edge in which more than 2,300 Palestinians were killed, two-thirds of them civilians.

“During Protective Edge, we addressed that part of American Jewry with an open letter that said if you want to support Israel, support a normal life for us, support our possibility to grow up in peace, support our possibility to grow untraumatised, support our possibility to be like a normal country and not have a mandatory draft, support our possibility to not be oppressing other people,” said Glezerman.

“But if you want to support us by blindly supporting the Israeli government, and not just this one but government after government sacrificing the people for an idea, you’re not supporting us. There is no pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. It’s either you’re pro both or pro neither.”

As Israeli protesters in Union Square see it, too often the American public is being asked to choose between recognising the terrible toll of the war on civilians in Gaza, who are among the majority of the more than 36,500 Palestinians killed, and the suffering of the 80 Israelis still believed to be alive and held by Hamas.

“We did not really find ourselves in either of the protests that were available to us because we didn’t make a differentiation between victims,” said Glezerman.

“There has been a phenomenon, ubiquitous on both sides of this discourse, of downplaying the trauma or the horror of what is happening to victims from the opposite side. The discourse is such that if you speak about the hostages, a large part of the American left will think that you are pro continuing the war.”

On the other hand, she said, many on the pro-Israel side don’t see the tension inherent in advocating for the hostages while supporting the war.

“If pro-Israel Americans think that supporting the war is supporting the hostages, perhaps they’re not getting all of the information. So when Americans glaze over that in favour of kind of a more coherent narrative that doesn’t have any glitches, that’s less helpful than they could be,” Glezerman said.

Despite the challenges navigating their own place in the protest movement, the Israeli peaceniks draw strength from the attention on the broader conflict after years in which the Palestinians were all but abandoned by the international community while Israel tightened its grip on the occupied territories.

“One bright light in all of this is that we’re not alone in our demand for justice and equality,” said Fort.

Glezerman agrees.

33,"Twenty Labour councillors from Lancashire have resigned in protest at the party’s national leadership.

They have claimed that Labour “wants to control anything that any councillor wants to say” and have suggested its selection processes are unfair.

All 10 Labour members of Pendle borough council, including its leader, and Labour councillors on Nelson town council and Brierfield town council in Lancashire will sit as independents.

Mohammed Iqbal, a Pendle councillor, said: “In the last few weeks there has been a culture developing from the national Labour party that seems to want to control anything that any councillor wants to say. Or where there is good hard-working councillors that have been serving the community for a number of years, the party nationally seem to dictate who can stand where and when.”

Iqbal was previously suspended from the party for 18 months over claims he had made antisemitic comments at a meeting. The councillor, who denies the claims, told Granada TV: “I joined the Labour party over 30 years ago and have always been encouraged to speak out on issues.”

The Labour leadership has faced criticism from parts of the party over its position on the Gaza conflict.
Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, said on Tuesday morning: “Everybody is allowed to have their own views and I fully understand why people feel really strongly about this issue. We saw what happened on October 7, we’ve seen what’s happened in the six months since then with tens of thousands of people being killed, and all the way through this we have said three things.”

He said Labour’s three demands in the conflict were a return of hostages, a ceasefire that lasts and a “better future for the Palestinian people”.

Asked about Iqbal’s departure, McFadden said: “If someone takes the decision to leave, that is something to be regretted, but what I am really focused on is the 2,000-plus Labour candidates who will be standing in the local elections in a few weeks’ time.”

Four of the councillors will stand for re-election in May’s polls, with candidate lists available by 4 April.

In November the leader of Burnley borough council and 10 other councillors resigned in protest at Keir Starmer’s refusal to call for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, after a spate of similar exits from the party at councils across England.",Twenty Labour councillors quit party in protest at leadership,The Guardian (London),"April 2, 2024 Tuesday 8:49 AM GMT",0.4561961,0.49128473,0.05251918,palestine_guardian1
34,"More than 100 people were arrested at Emerson College in Boston early on Thursday in the latest crackdown against the rising wave of campus pro-Palestinian protests across the US that has seen the House speaker, Mike Johnson, suggest calling in the national guard.

Johnson waded into an already tense situation on Wednesday with a visit to Columbia University, where the decision last week of the university president, Minouche Shafik, to invite the NYPD to dismantle a student encampment catalysed what is rapidly becoming a national movement. Johnson nevertheless called for the resignation of Shafik, facing jeers on campus from the pro-Palestinian protesters.

At University of Texas in Austin at least 34 protesters, including a member of the media from a local news station, were arrested overnight, while at 93 more were detained by police dressed in riot gear at the University of Southern California (USC), the Los Angeles Times reported.
In mass arrests at USC , militarized officers were filmed appearing to shoot rubber bullets into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. While described as “less-lethal weapons”, rubber bullets can cause serious injury or even death. Further north at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, protesters barricaded themselves in a university building using furniture, tents, chains and zip-ties, prompting a campus shutdown.

The arrests in Boston came after Emerson officials ordered student protesters on Wednesday to dismantle their encampment-style demonstration in the city’s Boylston Place Alley, where students had been protesting since Sunday, WBZ-TV reported.
Students say they were peacefully protesting when the mass arrests began around 1.30am on Thursday. One student who spoke to WBZ-TV anonymously said that students were “dragged” and “pushed away … without much regard for [their] safety.” A Boston police spokesperson told WBZ-TV that four officers were injured, all non-life-threatening.

The original encampments at Columbia called for the university to divest from weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel. The protests have led to mass suspensions of students, and the arrests of hundreds.
At Columbia, flanked by a number of Republican members of Congress, Johnson denounced the demonstrations as “mob rule” and condemned what he called a “virus of antisemitism” at colleges nationwide.

“And it’s detestable, as Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over,” he said. “If this is not contained quickly and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, there is an appropriate time for the national guard.”

Johnson’s speech drew boos from the crowd, as he also called for the resignation of Shafik, who he accused of failing to protect Jewish students and allowing protests that led to the arrest of dozens of people there last week.

As temperatures rose, Kathy Hochul, the Democratic governor of New York, called Johnson’s trip “divisive”, while the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez assailed authorities for the “reckless and dangerous act” of calling police to non-violent demonstrations.

Hochul accused Johnson of “politicizing” the issue, and “adding to the division”, according to the New York Post. “There’s a lot more responsibilities and crises to be dealt with in Washington,” she said.

Most of the protests involve pro-Palestinian students, some of them Jewish, demanding their schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies they consider to be enabling the brutal conflict in Gaza.

More than 140 students, faculty members and others were arrested on Monday night at a protest at New York University’s Manhattan campus.

At UC Berkeley, meanwhile, the “Free Palestine Camp” has grown over three days into a sit-in demanding their school sever its financial connections to BlackRock and other asset managers they see as complicit for financing genocide in Gaza. UC Berkeley holds a $427m investment in a BlackRock portfolio.
Some protesters are also calling for an academic boycott, which would end collaborations with Israeli universities and the establishment of a new Palestinian studies program.

Police responding to a demonstration at USC got into a back-and-forth tugging match with protesters over tents. As of 7pm local time more than a dozen people were arrested at the campus, according to a Los Angeles Times reporter on the scene. Video shows officers shoving students.

At Cal Poly Humboldt, a public university on California’s northern coast, the campus has been closed and classes are being held remotely after pro-Palestinian protesters barricaded themselves in a building for a sit-in. Dozens of students remain inside the building and have blocked entrances with furniture, according to the university, while others occupied another nearby building. Students there told the Sacramento Bee they felt compelled to take action.

“I think the solution is to get involved, because at least I can feel like I’m doing my part. Even if it’s not enough, I’m doing the best I can to make something of it. I find peace in that,” one student said.

At UT Austin, hundreds of local and state police – including some on horseback and holding batons – clashed with protesters, pushing them off the campus lawn and at one point sending some tumbling into the street.

A photographer covering the demonstration for Fox 7 Austin was arrested after being caught in a push-and-pull between officers and students, the station confirmed. A longtime Texas journalist was knocked down in the mayhem and could be seen bleeding before police helped him to emergency medical staff who bandaged his head.

Faculty at UT Austin will be striking in response to what they called a “militarized response” to a “peaceful, planned action”, stating on X that they are refusing to hold classes starting on Thursday.

At Columbia, the focal point of national student demonstrations, Shafik said on Wednesday that she had extended by 48 hours a deadline for talks with protest leaders for the dismantling of a tent encampment on Columbia’s west lawn.
Some Jewish students at Columbia said they had been physically blocked by protesters from attending classes, and subjected to racial hatred by demonstrators demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and for the university to divest from companies linked to Israel’s military operations.

Protest organizers blame outside actors for particularly inflammatory rhetoric against Jewish students.

Johnson’s visit to Columbia follows a number of other trips there this week by bipartisan groups of politicians. Three competing delegations attended on Monday, Axios reported , with the entirety of New York’s Republican congressional delegation demanding Shafik’s resignation, and Democrats criticizing her for not protecting Jewish students and faculty.

Joe Biden does not plan to visit Columbia when he visits New York on Friday, the White House and campaign officials told CNN. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a Wednesday statement that Biden believes free speech, debate and nondiscrimination are important on college campuses, adding that “students should feel safe on college campuses”.

35,"If you didn’t know what was really going on at US college campuses, the congressional hearing on Thursday – in which the presidents of Northwestern and Rutger’s and the chancellor of UCLA were called to testify before a Republican-controlled House committee – would do little to inform you.

The House committee on education and the workforce has held six – yes , six – public events to draw attention to the supposed crisis on campus in the months since the 7 October attack on Israel. They’ve hauled university presidents to Washington to harangue them, allegedly for not being sufficiently punitive toward pro-Palestinian students and faculty. These hearings have been used to belittle and antagonize university faculty and students and have fed racist and anti-intellectual moral panics that have led to the resignations of several of the university presidents who have been called to testify, notably including Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard.

The hearings have aimed to pressure colleges and universities to crack down on a wide variety of politically disfavored speech, particularly pro-Palestinian and anti-war speech, and particularly that of students and faculty of color. In many cases, this pressure seems to have yielded the desired results: at Columbia, Minouche Shafik, the university president, twice ordered the NYPD onto campus to conduct violent mass arrests of anti-genocide student protesters; the first of these raids came the day after Shafik testified before the House committee and disparaged her own students in degrading terms.

But on Thursday, at least, the university administrators seemed less nervous, a bit more subdued – even if they were not willing to defend the rights of their anti-war students or correct the Republicans’ lies about them.

Michael Schill, president of Northwestern, Jonathan Holloway, president of Rutgers and Gene Block, chancellor of UCLA, were calm, if occasionally annoyed, as the Republicans on the committee told them they should be “ashamed” for using insufficient violence against protesters, called for the defunding of specific programs and the firing of individual faculty members, demanded that undergraduate students be expelled and compared pro-Palestinian demonstrators with Nazis and the segregationist George Wallace. At one point, a Republican congressman also digressed into a prolonged grievance over the firing of a Northwestern football coach.

The Republican outrage at the college administrators is nominally due to what they say is a “scourge of antisemitism” on these campuses. That pretext is supported by the false conflation of anti-Zionism or simple concern for Palestinian life with antisemitic animus – a dangerous and insulting conflation that was made repeatedly and without contradiction throughout the hearing. In reality, the false equivalence of anti-Zionism with antisemitism is belied by the reality on the ground, in the campus anti-war encampments that have sprung up across the country and in the burgeoning young Jewish anti-Zionist movement. In the real world, Jewish students are not only safe and welcome in the encampments and in the broader anti-war movement; they are frequently emerging as intellectual and organizing leaders.

But this reality was not convenient for the Republicans, who hope to cynically use a fear of antisemitism to provide a shield of moral righteousness to their anti-education, anti-diversity, anti-intellectual and fundamentally racist project. The flimsy pretext of fighting antisemitism was required to provide a thin pretext for an effort that is at its core about rooting out and punishing disfavored ideologies and attempting to eliminate them from the public sphere. To say that this is an insult to the history of antisemitism would be an understatement.

The attempt to paint the anti-war movement as violent and malicious veered, at times, into the absurd. In one prolonged exchange, the hearing was shown a viral video, produced by a young Zionist influencer at UCLA. In the video, the man is standing in a path on campus, facing a small group of silent pro-Palestinian protesters wearing keffiyehs. The young man declares that he wants to pass them to go into an academic building. The students are mostly silent; one seems to ask him to use a different entrance. “I want to use THAT door,” the man says, pointing, and looking back at the camera. The protesters are quiet; they do not move. No one is violent, or even particularly agitated. The Republican committee members referred to this video repeatedly and in dramatic terms throughout the hearing, claiming it represented an epidemic of Jewish students being violently refused access to campus facilities.

Meanwhile, other events on UCLA’s campus went largely unremarked. For while a pro-Palestinian encampment was present on UCLA’s campus for some days, so were pro-Israel demonstrators, whose much better-funded demonstration featured large groups of Zionist protestors bussed in from off campus, along with a jumbotron that played pro-Israel propaganda at all hours. When they were there, the Zionist group jeered and taunted the anti-genocide protesters, allegedly yelling racial slurs and rape threats and even allegedly releasing rats into the encampment.

On the night of 30 April, a large group from the pro-Israel camp, many of them wearing Halloween masks, violently attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment. They brought “knives, bats, wooden planks, pepper spray and bear mace”, according to one witness , and proceeded to beat the anti-genocide protesters, pushing many into the ground using barricades. The police, whom UCLA had summoned to campus to help maintain order, stood by and allowed the attack to continue for hours. They seem to have assessed, correctly, what they were there to protect, and who they weren’t.

At the hearing on Thursday, the Republicans went to extensive lengths to criticize universities that have engaged in negotiations with their student protest encampments, calling these talks “capitulation” to “pro-terror” and “pro-Hamas” forces. Since the encampments sprung up at many campuses this spring, not all universities have chosen to disperse their students by having them beaten and arrested; some have engaged in dialogue – with varying degrees of good faith – and attempted to persuade the students to pack up the tents in exchange for material concessions.

At Northwestern, the successful negotiations resulted in a pledge from the administration to include funding for five undergraduate students and two faculty members from Palestine to come to campus, as part of the university’s broader international programming. This promise to include Palestinian scholars in campus life seemed to particularly offend the Republicans, who demanded to know why Jewish affinity groups had not been consulted before the commitment was made.

This is not typical of such university funding decisions: Why would a Russian-speakers’ club, say, be consulted before a scholarship was offered to a Ukrainian student? But the message from the outraged Republicans was clear: the inclusion of Palestinians in university life, they feel, should be subject to a Jewish person’s veto.

37,"Police used pepper spray on pro-Palestine activists during a protest that blocked part of a busy intersection next to the Flemington racecourse ahead of the Melbourne Cup.
Four people were in police custody on Tuesday afternoon after being arrested at the protest, where about 100 activists chanted “free Palestine” and “ceasefire now” outside the major sporting event and blocked a road leading to the racecourse.

Footage of the protest showed activists blocking the entrance and being surrounded by police.

In a video posted on social media, one protester is seen holding a lit flare while standing on top of a van, with the words “free Palestine” written on it. Videos also show police dragging protesters away from the scene as they attempted to move traffic through the intersection.

A Victoria police spokesperson said about 100 pro-Palestine protesters arrived at the roundabout at Epsom Road, Ascot Vale Road and Racecourse Road at about 11am.

“A female protester arrived in a white van and climbed on to the roof where for some time, she failed to obey police instructions to come down,” the spokesperson said.

“In the course of managing the non-compliant protesters, police sprayed protesters before arresting three of them, who were all male.”

The spokesperson said the female on top of the van was also arrested. Police arranged for the van to be towed away.

“The incident caused traffic disruptions at an important intersection on Melbourne Cup Day,” the spokesperson said.

“The incident resolved at about 1.15pm when police successfully dispersed the protesters.”

Zionism Victoria strongly condemned the protest and criticised its “disruptive” nature.

At last year’s Melbourne Cup, protesters dumped 1,000 litres of oily sludge on Flemington racecourse. Climate group Extinction Rebellion said the protesters behind that incident were friends of the group.

Pro-Palestine rallies were held across Australia over the past weekend, for the fourth week in a row, with thousands calling for a ceasefire and an end to the bombardment of Gaza.

Rallies were held in major cities across the country, including in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth, and came after over 10,000 people marched in Sydney on Saturday.

The Melbourne rally reportedly attracted tens of thousands of supporters to the State Library, where they marched through the city, chanting for a ceasefire.

The rally’s all came despite rain in some cities, and in increasing numbers as Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza in response to the Hamas attack that killed more than 1,400 people in early October.

The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network’s president, Nasser Mashni, said the protests had attracted “tens of thousands” of people and were set to continue.

“Generations of Australians have protested in solidarity with Palestinians, calling for Palestinian self-determination and freedom from Israeli occupation, for the past 75 years,” he said,

“The past five weeks alone, we’ve seen tens of thousands of people of good conscience across the continent protest against Israeli violence against Palestine.”

Separately, a Melbourne tribute wall to the 240 Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza was targeted with graffiti reading “Free Palestine” plastered along the “wall of hope”.

Dvir Abramovich, chair of the anti-defamation commission, condemned the defacing of the wall, saying it left the Jewish community “shocked and outraged”.

“This evil desecration of this wall, dedicated to those innocents kidnapped by the Hamas terrorists and held in Gaza, is a violation that must be condemned by every religious and political leader,” he said.

“This is personal for me, and these flyers [on the wall] express the profound pain we are feeling for the Israeli children, men and women abducted by Hamas. We want to ensure that they are not forgotten.”",Four arrested and pepper spray used as pro- Palestine protest blocks road to Melbourne Cup course,The Guardian (London),"November 7, 2023 Tuesday 5:41 AM GMT",0.6782589,0.3018403,0.019900877,palestine_guardian1
38,"British Palestinians have described the chaotic scenes in the House of Commons over the Gaza ceasefire vote as a farce and “political game playing” after the speaker allowed a Labour amendment to be debated, overturning years of parliamentary precedent.

Lindsay Hoyle went against convention by selecting the amendment for a vote as well as a government one. He has since come under pressure over his handling of the original Scottish National party motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

Tory and SNP MPs accused him of bowing to pressure from Keir Starmer to allow the Labour motion, which was passed. Hoyle said later he had been persuaded to allow both amendments because of “absolutely frightening” threats to the personal safety of many MPs.

The events were criticised by British Palestinians. Mira Hammad, 32, a British-Palestinian barrister, said the way the situation unfolded was “despicable”.

“To hear it being blamed on Palestine protesters, and the idea that people protesting for Palestine are dangerous or a threat to MPs, is just really despicable,” she said.

 “Palestinian lives are not a political game. There are real people that are human beings, it’s just disgusting to see this as a political game.

“It’s absolutely disgusting that a conversation that should have been about the safety of an active population living under bombardment and undergoing a genocide has become about the safety of MPs due to legitimate protests.”

Hammad added: “It just shows us that the horrors that are unfolding in Gaza couldn’t be further away from the concerns of the politicians in parliament.”

Kamel Hawwash, 62, a British-Palestinian academic, said: “It should have been quite simple. Those who believe there should be a ceasefire would have voted yes. Those who side with Israel would have voted no. It would have been a real measure of these MPs and their humanity and their morals. Unfortunately, it became a farce. It became chaos.

“I’m against protests outside MPs’ homes, but not outside their place of work or in their constituency offices. I think it’s legitimate for constituents to express their dissatisfaction and dismay at the lack of urgency to stop the killings in Gaza.”

Sara Husseini, 40, the director of the British Palestinian Committee, said the leadership of both main parties were “determined to shield Israel from any criticism or accountability at the expense of democracy in this country and the UK’s legal and moral duties to the Palestinian people”.

“British Palestinians, and the wider voting public, will not forget this,” she added.

Hadil Louz, 30, a PhD student at the University of St Andrews who was born in Gaza, said efforts to apply pressure on parliament to call for a ceasefire had been in vain. “I’m not watching the news any more. I just want to bring my family to safety. I really suffered from the UK attitude and the parliament attitude towards the ceasefire. And I protested in London, I protested in Dundee, I protested in St Andrews, and everything was in vain,” she said.
“I appreciate the solidarity of the people who go to the streets asking for a ceasefire. I really appreciate their efforts going to the streets every Saturday and every week. I haven’t found any support from the government. But I really felt the support of the people in the UK.”",‘Despicable’: British Palestinians react to Commons chaos over Gaza ceasefire,The Guardian (London),"February 22, 2024 Thursday 7:29 PM GMT",0.8452699,0.14550965,0.009220414,palestine_guardian1

It is, as Chris Martin points out, 25 years since Coldplay’s Glastonbury debut, a silver anniversary they commemorate tonight by unexpectedly dusting down an acoustic version of Sparks from their debut album Parachutes. Perhaps more pertinently, it’s the fifth time they’ve headlined the festival, and they’ve got the hang of it to such an extent that it increasingly feels like the job the quartet were put on earth to do.

Since their last appearance in 2016, they’ve completed a 180-degree turn from earnest stadium balladeers to purveyors of relentless, balls-out, more-is-more visual overload: their gigs are now effectively a 21st-century equivalent of U2’s Zoo TV shows, albeit without any of U2’s accompanying theorising about the media or the relationship between art and commerce.

This gig is played amid the eye-popping, ongoing Music of the Spheres tour, and everything that appeared to be cranked up to 11 when I saw it two years ago is now cranked up to 12. The end result makes Dua Lipa’s performance on Friday night look like the dernier cri in shy understatement.

Pyrotechnics and confetti cannons are used not as a special effect, but as a regular punctuation point, not deployed to signpost the climax of the show, but the arrival of choruses. Inflatables roll over the crowd, while equipping the audience with illuminated wristbands remains the best idea anyone’s had at a giant-scale gig since they worked out how to turn the big stage-side screens on: it’s both visually dazzling and dizzily effective at turning even the fringes of what looks like it will be the biggest crowd of the weekend into part of the performance.

It is shamelessly unsubtle crowd-pleasing stuff, from the obvious singalong anthems that precede their appearance – Don’t Look Back In Anger, Smells Like Teen Spirit – to a drone flying overhead broadcasting the vastness of the assembled masses back to them, to the level of flattery Martin lavishes on the festival and the audience itself: “Amazing wonderful people from all over the place… the greatest city on earth … the most important engine room in the world”.

Still, in the middle of the crowd, it would take a quite extraordinary level of churlishness not to be swept along in its wake. Whatever reasonable objections you might lodge against Coldplay do seem to melt away in the face of such cartoonish good fun – at a festival where there’s theoretically always something else going on to divert your attention, it’s a smart idea to continually give the audience something to look at – and a set toploaded with a relentless bombardment of greatest hits: Yellow, Clocks, Adventure of a Lifetime, The Scientist, Paradise, Viva La Vida, Higher Power.

Indeed, it’s so relentless that the middle section, during which they start rolling out the special guests feels like a respite, simply because the songs they’re guesting on are album tracks: Laura Mvula sings Violet Hill from Viva la Vida – intriguingly the solitary genuinely angry anti-war protest song in Coldplay’s catalogue – Little Simz raps on And So We Pray, from the forthcoming Moon Music, and Femi Kuti and Palestinian/Chilean singer Elyanna appear on an impressively powerful version of Arabesque, the highlight of 2019’s decidedly mixed bag Everyday Life.

The final part of the show occasionally skirts with a slightly cheesy daffiness as it attempts to find further stops to pull out: Martin gets the cameras to focus on individual audience members and makes up songs about them on the spot; he invites the crowd en masse to send out private messages of love to the world (the dispatch of said messages is marked with more fireworks).

But he still succeeds in carrying the crowd with it. For a finale, he unexpectedly brings out Michael J Fox, and then performs Fix You. The latter is arguably the most slender of Coldplay’s patented Big Tunes, but it feels noticeably bulked up by being sung en masse, to a backdrop of their trademark wristbands glowing a warm orange. Onstage, the cameras briefly focus on drummer Will Champion, who, rather sweetly, seems to be moved to tears. But even if it doesn’t leave you moist-eyed, Coldplay’s performance is the kind of Glastonbury set that no one present is likely to forget in a hurry.",Coldplay at Glastonbury review – Chris Martin takes tens of thousands on the adventure of a lifetime,The Guardian (London),"June 30, 2024 Sunday 1:21 AM GMT",0.013127671,0.22733493,0.7595374,palestine_guardian1
40,"On Monday, the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill announced that it would divert the school’s entire $2.3m diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) budget toward public safety and policing.

Some members of the board of trustees, which voted for the divestment, cited students’ recent anti-war demonstrations as a reason for the redesignation of funds to the campus police.

Monday’s unanimous board vote affects UNC Chapel Hill’s diversity funding, and could lead to the shuttering of the department and job losses. Conversely, the public safety and policing departments are getting a boost to their $14m budget.

Two weeks ago, student protesters at the school created an encampment on campus in solidarity with Palestine and against Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza. Thirty-six people were detained after refusing to disperse from campus; 27 people were cited for trespassing and released; and six others were arrested and charged with trespassing.

Though local Chapel Hill police were not involved, the UNC campus police were supported by North Carolina State University’s police, UNC Wilmington’s police, Appalachian State University’s police, state patrol officers and sheriff deputies (dressed in what looked like riot gear), according to the Daily Tarheel.
Some Chapel Hill council members, students and faculty were alarmed by the campus police’s response to students’ protests, and condemned what they called “an escalation of force”, which included “the use of pepper spray against its own students”.

Board members, however, defended the campus police. Days before Monday’s vote, Kotis wrote an inflammatory op-ed in the North State Journal about the students’ protests, and the lack of response from local law enforcement.

“The General Assembly needs to respond strongly to Cooper’s and Chapel Hill’s unwillingness to enforce law and order,” he wrote. “It should consider moving funds from any municipalities unwilling to support fellow law enforcement and give the UNC system the additional resources to handle emergencies like the one at UNC Chapel Hill last week.” According to the school’s website, the office of diversity and inclusion’s mission is to “create and sustain a diverse, inclusive and welcoming environment for all students, faculty and alumni”.

But the vice-chair of the board’s budget and finance committee, Marty Kotis, indicated that he considered the DEI programs to be disharmonious to the campus atmosphere. “I think that DEI in a lot of people’s minds is divisiveness, exclusion and indoctrination,” Kotis said at the meeting during which the vote was held. “We need more unity and togetherness, more dialogue, more diversity of thought.”

In a March interview with the assembly , board member Woody White wrote: “Though guised as a ‘student success’ support system, the reality is that on some campuses, the DEI regime has become the enforcement mechanism with which to push radical ideology. Under the auspice of ‘righting past wrongs,’ it has been weaponized to allow discrimination, and it pits races and genders against each other.”

UNC Chapel Hill’s commencement was held the day before Monday’s DEI announcement. At the ceremony, football stadium screens displayed a message that read: “Anyone who does not leave or put down signs when asked will be removed and arrested. Thank you for your cooperation.”",University of North Carolina to divert $2.3m DEI budget to safety and policing,The Guardian (London),"May 13, 2024 Monday 11:06 PM GMT",0.3223655,0.61599416,0.06164036,palestine_guardian1
41,"More protests demanding a ceasefire in Gaza were under way in the US on Friday morning, with police breaking up crowds and arresting demonstrators in various locations.

Such demonstrations come as recent polling shows that US public support for Israel is dropping, while the Hamas authorities in Gaza reported on Friday that more than 12,000 Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians and mostly women and children, had now been killed since Israel declared war on Hamas in October.

New York police on Friday arrested pro-Palestine supporters who occupied the headquarters of News Corp, the media company that owns the Fox News channel and the Wall Street Journal and New York Post newspapers, according to clips posted on social media.

Dozens of demonstrators gathered in the News Corp lobby, chanting, “Shame” and “Fox News … you can’t hide. Your lies cover up genocide.”

Pro-ceasefire demonstrators were also arrested on Friday in New York City after blocking the entrance to the headquarters building for BNY Mellon, a corporate investment company, which they said holds shares in weapons supply for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Meanwhile, students at Columbia University and New York University (NYU) were expected to hold a sit-in at an unnamed bank that funds NYU’s Tel Aviv campus sites.

Both universities have campus extensions in Israel, which student organizers say are built on top of former Palestinian villages.

The demonstration is meant to “highlight Columbia and NYU’s roles legitimizing Israeli apartheid” and “massive financial infrastructure … used to fund real estate projects at home and settler colonial expansions abroad”, the student organization said in a press release.

More protests are expected on Friday and throughout the weekend in New York , Chicago and other major US cities.

The latest demonstration comes after 200 people in San Francisco shut down a portion of the Bay Bridge in a protest calling for a ceasefire. At least 50 people were arrested after demonstrators formed a human chain between vehicles.

And at least 90 protesters were injured during a demonstration on Thursday in Washington DC on Capitol Hill. Organizers with the Ceasefire Now Coalition said that dozens of protesters sustained injuries after police violently broke up the peaceful demonstration.

Demonstrations against Israel’s airstrikes and military operations in Gaza have continued across the country, with tens of thousands of participants.

The latest actions come amid declining US public support for Israel in the past month, Reuters reported , citing an opinion poll.

According to polling from Reuters/Ispos, the majority of Americans believe that Israel should call a ceasefire. About 68% of respondents said they agreed that “Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate”.

A majority of Democratic voters also believe that Israel’s overwhelming response to the 7 October Hamas attack, in which the Islamist extremists killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and took hostages back to Gaza, is “too much”, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.
And 56% of Democrats have said that Israel’s military operations in Gaza have been too much, which is 21 points higher than a similar survey last month.

People of color in the US as well as those under the age of 45 also believe that Israel’s response has been disproportionate, pointing to generational and racial splits around support for Israel.

Meanwhile, 52% of Republicans viewed Israel’s response as “about right”, an increase from last month’s poll when more Republicans then viewed Israel’s reaction as “too little”.

42,"A UK government adviser on social cohesion has described attempts to portray protesters on pro-Palestinian marches as extremist as “outrageous” and dangerous.

Dame Sara Khan, who is carrying out a review of the resilience of the UK’s democracy for Michael Gove, said such claims risked further dividing the country.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been regularly massing on the streets of London to protest against the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces.

The former home secretary Suella Braverman has described the demonstrations as “hate marches” and the government’s commissioner for counter-extremism, Robin Simcox, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Friday that London had been “permitted to be turned into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend”.

Speaking to the Guardian, before Simcox’s comments were published, Khan said she believed the UK had a problem with extremism but that people should be careful in their language.

Khan, who was Simcox’s predecessor as the government’s counter-extremism commissioner, said: “I think it’s really important that we don’t conflate those protesters, somehow saying or portraying them as somehow as being all extremists.

“What I’ve been really uncomfortable with over the last couple of weeks is the kind of argument that they’re all Islamist extremists on these demonstrations. I think that’s actually outrageous.

“Some are not even pro-Palestinian people, just anti-war. There are clearly Jewish people there, there’s a whole range of people there, and to try to frame these demonstrations as Islamist extremism is completely far-fetched and untrue.”

Khan was appointed as an independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience in 2022 and is expected to complete her review this month.

The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has not gone as far as some within the Conservative party in criticising the marches in London but he has recently warned against “mob rule”.

In a speech last Friday on the steps of Downing Street, Sunak further claimed the protests had “descended into intimidation, threats, and planned acts of violence”, and called on those demonstrating not to “let the extremists hijack your marches”.

In his article for the Telegraph, Simcox said the government and its agencies had powers to combat extremism but had failed to tackle groups that “lurked” just below the threshold of counter-terrorism legislation.

“We will not have become an authoritarian state if London is no longer permitted to be turned into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend”, Simcox wrote.

Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, warned, however, against attempts to curtail freedom of expression and assembly on the basis that it might make some parts of society unhappy.

He said: “There is an irony, if Jews were a lot more disorderly and went in and did violent counter protests, you probably could say that the conduct of the protesters was liable to lead to public disorder, and therefore invoke that as a reason for limiting marches. And that’s not the case.

“When you’re thinking about something as important as the right to protest, there doesn’t seem to be a solid enough basis for curtailing that because I think we can all think of causes very personal to us that we would want to protest an awful lot and that will make some people very, very unhappy indeed.”

Next week, ministers are expected to announce a new definition of extremism, determining the organisations that Whitehall will be prohibited from engaging with.

According to leaked drafts, it will include groups active in “the promotion or advancement of an ideology based on intolerance, hatred or violence that aims to undermine the rights or freedoms of others”, including “those who seek to undermine or overturn the UK’s liberal system of democracy and democratic rights”.

Hall, who saw an early version of the draft definition but who has not been further consulted this year, said he agreed with his predecessor as reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, who had been critical of previous attempts to define extremism on the basis of British values.

Hall told the Guardian: “If you say a touchstone of British values is, for example, tolerance towards gay people then you end up saying that people who are religiously committed to saying that homosexuality is a sin are extremists,” he said.

“Then you end up creating a situation in which the UK’s … famously pluralist tolerance towards different belief systems is not tolerant towards that belief system. So it’s really hard to try and work out what are the touchstones for British values.”","Calling Gaza protesters extremist risks dividing UK, says government adviser",The Guardian (London),"March 8, 2024 Friday 11:02 AM GMT",0.70701444,0.27694204,0.016043536,palestine_guardian1
43,"Protesters who attended a pro-Palestine rally in Sydney on Tuesday night that was forcibly broken up by police have disputed the New South Wales premier Chris Minns’ claim that the response to the event was reasonable.

NSW police arrested and charged 23 people who attended the protest at Port Botany directed at the unloading of a ship owned by Israeli company ZIM, which has supported the Israeli government in its fight with Hamas in Gaza.

The organisers, Palestine Justice Movement Sydney and Unionists for Palestine, along with civil rights groups, condemned the police for their response after riot squad and mounted officers forcibly tried to disperse the crowds, which included children.

Guardian Australia has spoken with a number of protesters who claimed the police were aggressive and appeared unconcerned about the potential for a crowd crush as a result of their actions.

An Australian Services Union member and protester, Hannah Thomas, claimed the protest was a “peaceful sit-in” until police arrived and began “ripping up” attenders from the road in a “ruthless and rough” manner.

“They started pulling people up by their clothes and limbs,” she said.

“Cops were ripping up protesters. Mounted police started running their horses into the crowd.”

Thomas said protesters tried to get out of the way but the exit was a narrow pathway and there was potential for a “terrifying” crowd crush.

“It felt like police were … recklessly indifferent to it,” Thomas claimed.

“I found what has been really shocking is that despite how much footage there is, that the premier has backed the police.”

Freelance photographer and journalist Ran Fields witnessed and filmed the police response and said in no instance did he see any of the protesters “act first”.

“They were not aggressive in the crowd. They were not provoking the officers in the crowds,” he said.

Fields, who showed the videos he took to Guardian Australia to corroborate his claims, said he did not think the way in which the officers were engaging with the protesters was proportionate.

“A person was being held down but also given an order to stand up, but their legs were being contorted by another officer,” he claimed.

“And the police officer came and smacked their phone out of their hands, grabbed them by the arm and slung … their body into the ground.”

NSW police declined to comment further when contacted by Guardian Australia.

 Rights groups voice ‘deep concern’
The NSW Council for Civil Liberties, the Human Rights Law Centre and the Australian Democracy Network released a joint statement saying they were “deeply concerned” about the “police repression of a peaceful protest”.

They also accused police of causing a “crowd crush” and alleged that officers “physically pushed” several independent legal observers who were there.

The premier defended the police and said he “completely rejected” any suggestion their response was disproportionate.

Addressing the media on Wednesday, Minns said the protesters had occupied a street without organisers lodging a form 1 declaration, which they were required to do in order for the event to be “authorised”.

“It was only after ample time was given to the protesters to leave the roadway and allow commerce to transact in that port were arrests effected,” he said.

“Now, I think any reasonable person would say, once you stack up that chronology, the police acted completely responsibly.”

The police commissioner, Karen Webb, said police were “very patient” in dealing with the protesters and only took “proportionate” action when they failed to comply with orders to move on.

Webb claimed a “large number” of the people present were “professional protesters” who were “currently protesting about the Gaza conflict but next week they’ll probably protest about something else”.

The protesters who were arrested were charged with failing to comply with a move on direction and damaging or disrupting a major facility. One 29-year-old woman was also charged with assaulting a police officer without causing actual bodily harm.

Police said all of the people arrested were released on bail except for two, a 24-year-old man and another 29-year-old woman, who were remanded in custody to appear at the Downing Centre local court on Wednesday.

The NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, threw his support behind the police. He said it was “disturbing” that there had been a confrontation at a public place and people’s right to import goods had been disrupted.

Speakman called on Minns and the police minister, Yasmin Catley, to condemn the Sydney branch of the Maritime Union of Australia for their involvement in the protest.

Minns attempted to distance his government from the union on Wednesday morning. The MUA, which is affiliated with the NSW Labor party, declined to comment.

NSW Greens MPs Sue Higginson and Jenny Leong accused police of responding to the protesters with “unprovoked and unbridled aggression”.

“Violence against peaceful protesters can never be justified – and must never be tolerated,” they said.

One of the protest’s organisers, Ahmed Abadla, condemned the police response, saying the protest was a “peaceful, nonviolent boycott”.",Rights groups condemn ‘police repression’ at ‘peaceful’ pro-Palestine rally in Sydney,The Guardian (London),"November 22, 2023 Wednesday 2:33 AM GMT",0.67610395,0.303363,0.02053315,palestine_guardian1
44,"Joe Biden told graduating students of Morehouse College that American democracy has failed the Black community, but vowed to continue fighting “the poison of white supremacy”, in a widely watched speech to a historically Black college during an election year.

Despite a backlash from some students and alumni in the weeks leading up to Biden’s commencement address, including over the Hamas-Israel war and concerns that Biden would use the speech as a campaign event, the president’s address to the all-male school was warmly received. He used his speech to reaffirm his commitment to democracy in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, and to reiterate his call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Biden’s appearance at Morehouse comes as part of his campaign efforts in Georgia, a key swing state in the 2020 election, and as polls suggest his support from young voters and voters of color – who were integral to the coalition that helped him beat Donald Trump in 2020 – appears to be flagging slightly.

Despite criticism over Biden’s visit, the mood at Morehouse seemed upbeat and when a speaker asked attendees to welcome Biden they responded with applause and cheers.

“Black men are being killed in the street. What is democracy? A trail of broken promises still leaving Black communities behind,” Biden said. “What is democracy? – You have to be 10 times better than others to get a fair shot.”

“What does it mean,” Biden continued, “to be a Black Man who loves his country even if it doesn’t love him back in equal measure?”

“My commitment to you [is] to show you democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way,” he said.

Biden also warned about the powerful tide of extremism. “Insurrectionists storming the Capitol with Confederate flags are called patriots by some – not in my house,” Biden said to applause. “We all bleed the same color. In America, we’re all created equal.”

Biden also reaffirmed his commitment to an end to the Gaza conflict. “I support peaceful nonviolent protests,” he said. “Your voices should be heard and I promise you: I hear you.”

Biden said the war in Gaza was “heartbreaking”, discussed the horror of Hamas’s 7 October attack and of the plight of Palestinians. “Innocent Palestinians are caught in the middle of this,” he said. “It’s a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate ceasefire.”

Despite concerns over disruptions, nobody interrupted Biden’s address, though one lone graduate stood with his back turned to Biden with his right fist raised.

The valedictorian, DeAngelo Jeremiah Fletcher, also addressed the Gaza conflict in his speech.

“The Israel-Gaza conflict has plagued the people of its region for generations. It is important to recognize that both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the wake of October 7,” Fletcher said. “From the comfort of our homes, we watched an unprecedented number of civilians mourn the loss of men, women and children.

“It is my stance as a Morehouse man, and as a human being, to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”

Fletcher was met with applause, including from Biden.

Biden also received an honorary doctorate of laws from Morehouse, which counts Dr Martin Luther King among its many renowned alumni.

Morehouse invited Biden to serve as graduation speaker in September, prior to Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israeli civilians that left some 1,200 dead. In April, it announced he would also be the recipient of the honorary degree. The Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine–Georgia condemned his appearance.

“More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children,” the group said in a statement. “More than 77,000 have been injured. Every hospital and university in Gaza has been destroyed. None of this would have been possible without the support and sponsorship of the Biden Administration. Any college or university that gives its commencement stage to President Biden in this moment is endorsing genocide.”

Steve Benjamin, head of the White House Office of Public Engagement, met with Morehouse students and faculty for several hours ahead of Biden’s appearance, to listen to their concerns that Biden would treat his commencement address as a stump speech.

After the Morehouse speech Biden is expected to travel to Detroit, where he will give an address at the NAACP Freedom Fund dinner and highlight how his administration’s policies have helped Black Americans.

45,"More than 350 protesters shut down part of Oxford Street on Saturday as they staged a sit-in protest during the shopping district’s busiest hours.

The demonstration, organised by the Free Palestine Coalition, a collective of grassroots groups standing in solidarity with Palestine, occupied a busy junction and stopped traffic for more than an hour by sitting down in the road.

Protesters chanted “from the river to the sea” and held banners calling for a ceasefire and “no more business as usual”.

The newly formed coalition, which includes Sisters Uncut, Black Lives Matter UK and the Black-Jewish Alliance, began the demonstration at the BBC’s headquarters in Portland Place, before moving to Oxford Street, demanding that the broadcaster end what they claimed was biased coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

It comes after a week of similar disruptive actions at UK transport hubs, including Birmingham New Street and London’s Waterloo, Liverpool Street and King’s Cross stations.

The sit-in was part of a number of protests taking place across the capital on Saturday in support of Palestine, with thousands expected to take to the streets across the UK for the fourth consecutive week of demonstrations over the conflict.
A pro-Palestine rally was due to be held in Trafalgar Square from about 2.30pm on Saturday, with protesters calling for a ceasefire. Similar events were planned in Liverpool, Newcastle, Bristol and other towns and cities across the UK.

The Metropolitan police said there will be a “sharper focus” on using social media and face recognition to detect criminal behaviour at protests this weekend.

The force has also said pro-Palestine protesters will be prevented from gathering outside the Israeli embassy.

On social media, videos were shared showing a crowd of anti-Zionist protesters on a London tube train chanting “smash the Zionist settler state”, “resistance is justified when Palestine is occupied” and “there is only one solution – intifada revolution”.

In October, video footage was posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that appeared to show a Central line driver leading tube passengers in a “Free Palestine” chant using the train’s announcement system.

British Transport Police (BTP) and Transport for London (TfL) have said they are investigating the incident, and that the driver had been suspended.

Police have imposed a condition under section 14 of the Public Order Act to prevent demonstrators gathering near the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London.

Before the rallies on Saturday, the chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, said the lines between pro-Palestinian protesters and “those who support the brutal terrorism of Hamas” had become “badly blurred”.

Writing in the Times , Mirvis highlighted a Manchester protest with a banner showing support for “Palestinian resistance” and said there was no ambiguity in the words used.

He wrote: “Did every person who attended that march truly wish to associate themselves with acts of such barbarity? I sincerely hope that they did not.

“Nevertheless, it could not be clearer that, at the very least, the lines between those who wish only to advocate for the welfare of innocent Palestinians and those who support the brutal terrorism of Hamas have become badly blurred.

“Those lines have remained blurred in the subsequent demonstrations, in which a minority have proudly displayed their extremism on their banners and in their chants, while the majority stand alongside them.”

The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, responded to concerns from Rishi Sunak and the home secretary, Suella Braverman, about pro-Palestine protests planned to take place on Armistice Day next week.

Sunak said marches planned for 11 November would be “provocative and disrespectful” and warned that the Cenotaph – the focus of remembrance events – could be “desecrated” by protesters.

Both the march organisers and the Met have said the protest will avoid Whitehall, where the war memorial is located.

In a letter to Sunak, Rowley said: “Like you, I recognise the profound significance of Armistice Day and the events that take place across the weekend in central London and in communities across London.

“We will take a robust approach and yesterday I set out our intent to use all the powers available to the MPS [Metropolitan police service], including putting in place conditions, if required, to ensure events in Whitehall and the surrounding areas as well as other locations of significance across London are not undermined.”

Braverman, writing on X, described the planned protests as a “hate march” and said there was “an obvious risk of serious public disorder, violence and damage”.

The TV presenter and former England footballer Gary Lineker weighed into the row, defending the planned protests in a reply to the home secretary.

“Marching and calling for a ceasefire and peace so that more innocent children don’t get killed is not really the definition of a hate march,” he said.",Protesters block London’s Oxford Street in pro- Palestine demonstration,The Guardian (London),"November 4, 2023 Saturday 1:08 PM GMT",0.4021393,0.5350886,0.06277211,palestine_guardian1
46,"At least 570 professors at Harvard have defended the university’s embattled president, Claudine Gay, as she faces calls to resign following statements on campus antisemitism that have already triggered the resignation of the University of Pennsylvania president.
The faculty submitted a petition to the 13-member Harvard Corporation, which has the authority to fire the president, asking it not to bend to political pressure to remove her.

Appearing before a congressional inquiry last week , Gay, along with Sally Kornbluth, the president of MIT, and Liz Magill, the president of University of Pennsylvania, answered more than five hours of questions over their response to antisemitism on their campuses. Frequent student protests over the Israel-Gaza conflict have triggered accusations that some of the rhetoric has crossed into antisemitism.

Gay, Kornbluth and Magill all declined to provide a definitive “yes” or “no” answer to the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik’s question about whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their university’s code of conduct.

More than 70 US lawmakers signed a letter demanding all three university presidents be removed in response. Magill resigned, as did the University of Pennsylvania’s chairman of the board of trustees.

“One down. Two to go,” said Stefanik – one of Trump’s most vocal defenders, who has echoed the antisemitic “great replacement” theory of immigration – after Magill’s resignation.
Gay apologised for her congressional testimony in an interview with the Harvard Crimson student newspaper.

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said.

“Let me be clear: calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

The letter signed by faculty urged the Harvard Corporation “in the strongest possible terms to defend the independence of the university and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay”.

“The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,” it added.

The backlash over her testimony has seen the House committee on education and the workforce announce an official congressional investigation into antisemitism at Harvard, the rabbi David Wolpe resign from an advisory group established to combat antisemitism on Harvard’s campus, and the billionaire hedge fund CEO and Harvard donor Bill Ackman, one of Gay’s most vocal critics, claiming to have cancelled billions of dollars of pledges.

Four undergraduate students at Harvard are facing disciplinary action for leading or playing a role in a pro-Palestine “week of action” in November.

During a walkout on 29 November, two students are accused of entering and leading students out of classrooms while chanting “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, and “free, free Palestine”, according to the Harvard Crimson. One of the four students who face new disciplinary cases denied playing an organization role, or being a member of any of the groups involved in the walkout.

“It feels as though the school is caving to the pressure of rightwing politicians to discipline peaceful pro-Palestinian speech and protest on Harvard’s campus by targeting outspoken pro-Palestinian voices like mine,” Syd Sanders wrote in response to the disciplinary case.",Harvard professors defend president amid calls to resign after statements on antisemitism,The Guardian (London),"December 11, 2023 Monday 3:00 PM GMT",0.63368285,0.3467127,0.01960441,palestine_guardian1
47,"Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s brand new US election newsletter.

I moved to the US from the UK as a keen but inexperienced reporter in 2011, and was immediately plunged into covering the 2012 presidential election, despite having next to no knowledge of American politics. After the ignominy of travelling to a Newt Gingrich campaign event and having to ask an audience member who Newt Gingrich was, I decided I needed to learn more.

Thirteen years later, much of it spent observing (sometimes open-mouthed) the chaos that goes on here when it’s time to vote, I’m now on my fourth Big Election. And I’m excited to be joining all of you every week – and more frequently as the big day gets closer – for what is likely to be the most important one of those elections yet.

Today, with just six months to go before the vote, as police storm an occupied building at Columbia University and violence erupts on UCLA campus, we’ll take a look at what the wave of pro-Palestinian student protests across the US could mean in November.

But first, some of the happenings in US politics.

 Here’s what you need to know …
 1. Trump’s mouth gets him further into debt Donald Trump already owes $454m as a result of his civil fraud case in New York, and has been ordered to pay $88.3m to E Jean Carroll over a defamation lawsuit. Given Trump struggled to find the money for the former, the last thing he needed was to be fined $9,000 in his New York criminal trial, after he attacked witnesses online. Could the judge give him jail time if he does it again?

 2. Biden’s banter bus “The 2024 election is in full swing and yes, age is an issue,” Joe Biden said at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday. “I’m a grown man running against a six-year-old.” The joke continued Biden’s transition from grownup-in-the-room to Burn King in Chief , with the president and his campaign increasing their mocking attacks on Trump’s golf game , finances and mental aptitude.
 3. Debate club Republicans have been calling for Biden to agree to debate Trump, and on Friday Biden said he would do it , setting the stage for a tête-à-tête sometime after September. The three debates between these two in 2020 are mostly remembered for Trump interrupting, whining and calling on a white supremacist group to “stand back and stand by” , so let’s not get too excited just yet.

 Could student protesters turn the 2024 election?
Tensions on university campuses, already high as a wave of pro-Palestinian encampment-style protests sweeps the US, got even higher overnight.

The protests, which have seen students pitch tents or occupy buildings at Columbia , Harvard , the University of Pennsylvania and others, began as an effort to get universities to ditch investments in companies which provide weapons and equipment to the Israeli military.

But they have since evolved into a full-throated critique of how the Biden administration, in protesters’ eyes, has failed to rein in Israel during its war in Gaza. More than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza , and as with other modern conflicts, much of the horror has been shared on social media.

It has made it easy for people on campuses and elsewhere to empathise with the plight of Palestinians – and to grow angry at Biden, who has remained largely supportive of Israel in the wake of the October 7 attacks and last week signed a foreign aid package which directed more than $26bn to the country.

Polling averages show Trump with a narrow lead in the seven swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – which are the key to winning the White House. Biden won Wisconsin, where demonstrations continue on campuses in Milwaukee and Madison , by just 21,000 votes in 2020, and has already survived pro-Palestinian protest votes against him in Pennsylvania and Michigan , where he won by similarly small margins.

All this means that, basically, Biden can ill afford to lose any young votes.

“The real threat to Biden is that younger voters, especially college-educated voters, won’t turn out for him in the election,” Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, told me this week.

He added: “In states like Pennsylvania the margins are going to be so small, that it’s at least possible that a couple thousand people not turning out, or voting for one of the third party candidates, could swing the election one way or the other.”

Although Gaza is not necessarily a front-burner issue among all young voters (the economy remains many Americans’ No 1 concern), Biden’s popularity with them, well, is not what it was. In April, a Harvard poll found that 60% of 18-29-year-olds believe the country is “off on the wrong track”, while only 9% believe things are “generally headed in the right direction”. Neither of those numbers sound as if young people are about to sprint down to the polls to cast their vote for Biden.

But the problem goes further than just Biden losing votes among young people. Rightwing media and the GOP have pounced on the issue, claiming that the “out of control” protests are representative of Biden’s presidency.

It makes life difficult for Biden. If he sides with the students, Republicans will continue to paint the president as someone unable to reign in chaos. If Biden is too critical of protesters, he risks alienating young people – who he needs in November.

 Lie of the week
“I used to drive an 18-wheeler,” Biden said at a campaign event last week, referring to a vehicle also known as a tractor trailer or an HGV. The president was responding to a union member who had praised Biden for saving his pension.

The problem is: Biden never drove an 18-wheeler.
According to PolitiFact in 2021, after Biden made similar claims about his trucker past: “There’s no record that he drove an 18-wheeler, the typical meaning of a tractor trailer. The closest experience he had was in 1973, when, as a senator, he rode along on a 536-mile tractor-trailer trip from Delaware to Ohio.”

But Biden isn’t the only president to have a fascination with big trucks. Some people might remember the childlike delight on Donald Trump’s face when he was invited to sit in a truck cab in 2017. He got to honk the horn and everything!

 Worst week: Kristi Noem in the doghouse
“I hated that dog,” writes Kristi Noem – seen, until now, as a contender to be Trump’s vice presidential pick – in a new book , a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian, which broke the news last week.

The hard-right governor of South Dakota was talking about her time as a farmer some 20 years ago when her dog Cricket, a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer, attacked some chickens.

So, writes Noem, she shot and killed Cricket in a gravel pit – an experience she describes as “not a pleasant job”. (She also killed an unwanted goat.)

We may never know why Noem decided to commit this anecdote to print, other than poor political instincts. After an outraged response from people from all sides of the political spectrum, her chances of being vice-president are now reportedly zero.
RIP Cricket.

 Elsewhere in US politics
 Joe Biden narrowly won Georgia in 2020 , and Democrats are desperate to hang on to it. To that end, Kamala Harris was dispatched to Atlanta on Monday, in what our George Chidi describes as the “continuation of a full court press” to solidify support among Democrats, particularly Black Democrats.

 A physician, a lawyer, a CEO: that’s not the start of a joke, but instead some of the cast of 84 fake electors who allegedly tried to steal the 2020 election. Kira Lerner looked at the cast of characters. (There’s also a dairy farmer, a real estate agent and a QAnon fan.)

 The Senate election in very-Republican Nebraska has been shaken up by the candidacy of Dan Osborn, a pipe-fitter and union organizer from Omaha who in 2021 led a workers’ strike against Kellogg’s. Michael Sainato chatted with Osborn about whether he could spring a surprise.

 Last word goes to …
… Don Blankenship, running to be the Democratic Senate candidate in West Virginia with the weirdest political ad of 2024. (So far.)

There’s a lot going on here. Is that 1980s pop star Tiffany looming behind Don Blankenship? Why is Robert F Kennedy Jr featured so prominently? When the voice over says: “Our government is not honest,” why does the video cut to eight non-white Democratic politicians? And what’s going on with the line: “If they tell you I fell off the bed and hung myself, I didn’t”? (Hint: he’s not the only one to say it, which the Bulwark reports has become popular among “people who style themselves dissidents, flattering themselves that powerful people may be trying to get rid of them soon”.)

48,"Hundreds of protesters in London have staged a sit-in on Westminster Bridge, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in the first big demonstration of the year.

Elsewhere on Saturday, there were protests in Belfast and Dublin.

The London protesters blocked off the bridge and the surrounding roads after a march from St James’s Park in the centre of the city.

The demonstration, organised by the Free Palestine Coalition, renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. It also called for the UK to stop arms sales to Israel and an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine.

The group announced a meeting location – a drinking fountain in St James’s Park – at 10am on Saturday and protesters began to gather around midday.

The Metropolitan police made several arrests at the park, before protesters marched through Westminster and were then stopped by officers in Parliament Square, next to Big Ben.

Hundreds of the protesters joined a sit-in on the bridge, with some staging a die-in, laying down and refusing to leave. Protesters chanted: “One, two, three, four, occupation no more,” while clapping and shouting “free Palestine” and holding up flags and placards demanding the British government support Palestine.

Some protesters wore face masks of British politicians, including Rishi Sunak, and of the US president, Joe Biden, and held up hands covered in red paint.

The Met police said on Saturday afternoon: “All protesters have now left the area around Westminster Bridge. Officers remain on-duty in central London and are ready to respond to any further demonstrations.”

Thousands of people in Belfast marched at a rally outside Belfast city hall, also calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

People carried placards criticising the Israeli regime and gathered outside the gates of the building to hear a series of speeches, interspersed with chants and songs voicing support for the Palestinian people.

Outside RTÉ’s headquarters in Dublin, 108 pairs of shoes were laid out, each pair representing a journalist killed since the conflict began in October, activists said.

Speaking outside Belfast City Hall, the northern secretary of the INTO teaching union, Mark McTaggart, who is also a spokesperson for the Trade Union Friends of Palestine group, reflected on the numbers of students and teachers who have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank.

“We look at what happened in our country during the time when there was unrest – education was the last bastion of hope for most people, it was the schools and the schoolteachers from across the north who kept children safe and schools were seen as places of safety. Those chances and those life chances are being taken away from young people across Palestine,” he said. McTaggart also encouraged people to boycott Israeli goods and companies.

Hundreds of people attended a demonstration organised by the Cork Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Similar demonstrations have taken place in the city every weekend since the conflict erupted.

Naomi Sheehan, a sustainable development scientist who attended the protest outside RTÉ’s headquarters in Dublin organised by the group Mothers Against Genocide, said Ireland’s national broadcaster should be referring to Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocide”.

“It’s hard to even speak about this because it is so emotional, this is like witnessing the worst human rights atrocities of our times,” she said. “It’s a silent genocide and we are hearing a deafening silence in terms of assigning appropriate accountability to the forces who are enabling this genocide.”

Ireland has also witnessed pro-Israeli demonstrations in a number of cities since the conflict began in October. Saturday’s pro-Palestinian protests were staged after Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, warned that a widening of the conflict in the Middle East would have devastating consequences for the world.

His comments came as Hezbollah in Lebanon claimed it fired dozens of rockets at Israeli observations posts after it blamed Israel for a strike on Beirut that killed a senior Hamas official during the week.

Martin rejected comments by Israeli government ministers calling for the resettlement of Palestinians outside Gaza, saying they were “utterly unacceptable and inflammatory”.

“Gaza is Palestinian land and is an integral part of a future state of Palestine,” he added.

Martin also further expressed concern about the situation in the Red Sea where commercial ships have been attacked by Houthi rebels from Yemen. Attacks are not only putting the lives of the crews in danger, he said, but are also having an “increasingly serious impact on global trade”.

The tánaiste said the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was “more urgent than ever” and stressed the urgency of the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza and “full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access” to the enclave.

“Events across the region in recent days are also a stark reminder of the potential for further escalation,” said Martin.

“A widening of this conflict would have devastating consequences for the region and for the world. The international community simply cannot allow further civilian suffering and deaths. I urge all parties in the region to exercise restraint and avoid escalation.

“As always, it is the poorest and most vulnerable communities – in the Middle East, Africa and globally – that are the most severely affected.”

49,"The British Museum closed its doors to visitors on Sunday afternoon as hundreds of protesters gathered outside to demand that it end its partnership with BP – and sought to draw a link with the conflict in Gaza.

A new UK-based protest group, calling itself Energy Embargo for Palestine, called on members of the public to boycott the museum while it continues to receive sponsorship from the company.

In a statement published on the leftwing website Jacobin, the protesters pointed to offshore gas exploration licences granted to companies – including BP – by Israel , since the start of the war on Gaza.

A banner held up outside the museum’s entrance said: “Sponsored by BP = sponsored by colonial genocide.”

Sources at the British Museum confirmed on Sunday that the institution had closed its main entrances on the advice of the Metropolitan police, adding that visitors who had arrived before 3pm were able to remain inside.

The source added that the museum was working to allow people who had booked tickets for exhibitions for later time-slots to swap these to another day.

The British Museum, which is chaired by the former the Tory chancellor George Osborne, signed a new £50m, 10-year partnership with BP last year.

The deal is intended to fund an ambitious redevelopment of its Bloomsbury building but prompted furious criticism from climate campaigners, who have long called for it to sever its links with fossil fuels.

Sunday’s gathering appeared to mark a fresh front in the criticism of the museum, however, as it brought together campaigners against the climate emergency and protesters against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.

A spokesperson for the museum said: “The British Museum respects other people’s right to express their views and allows peaceful protest on site at the museum as long as there is no risk to the collection, staff or visitors.”

At the time the new sponsorship deal was announced, Louise Kingham, BP’s senior vice-president for Europe, said: “As a business that has made Britain its home for over a century, we are proud to be a long-term partner to this important British institution and play our part in its future transformation – while helping to ensure that this iconic cultural venue remains freely accessible to all.”",British Museum closes to visitors as Energy Embargo for Palestine group gathers outside,The Guardian (London),"March 24, 2024 Sunday 5:42 PM GMT",0.23554724,0.620842,0.14361075,palestine_guardian1
50,"At least 40 pro-Palestine protest camps have arisen across US campuses following Columbia University’s example earlier this month, as the New York school’s senate called for an investigation into its leadership, the New York Times reported.

While many remain provocative though peaceful, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and divestment by their institutions from companies with ties to Israel, hundreds of students and outside protesters have been arrested, and there have been some fierce clashes with police.

At least 100 more students were arrested overnight into Friday, mostly at Emerson College in Boston, while two dozen were taken into custody at Ohio State University.

At Columbia University, a proposal to censure university president Minouche Shafik fell short, but a resolution calling for an investigation passed by a vote of 62-14 on Friday, according to the New York Times. Shafik has been scrutinized since a decision last week to summon New York police to the campus and authorize them to dismantle an encampment, resulting in the arrest of more than 100 student protesters.

Columbia student protesters said that after meetings Thursday and Friday, the university hadn’t met their primary demand for divestment, although they had made progress on a push for more transparent financial disclosures.

“We will not rest until Columbia divests,” said Jonathan Ben-Menachem, a fourth-year doctoral student.

One member of the Columbia encampment, Khymani James, apologized for saying in a January social media video that “Zionists don’t deserve to live”.

“What I said was wrong,” James said in a statement on Friday. “Every member of our community deserves to feel safe without qualification.”

A university spokesman said James had been banned from campus and faced disciplinary action.

Meanwhile, at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where police allegedly used rubber bullets and teargas on protesters, Thursday’s escalation led to the arrest of Noëlle McAfee, chair of the philosophy department. Before the arrest, she had posted a video showing the Atlanta police department walking into the encampment.

“I had come by to make sure the university president had not called in the APD, but he did,” she posted. “Then I witnessed a young person being viciously pummeled by the cops. After demanding that they stop and refusing to step away, I was arrested.”

Also at Emory, economics professor Caroline Fohlin was detained by police. Authorities dragged Fohlin to the ground and handcuffed her after she shouted: “What are you doing?” to an officer making another arrest.

In Columbus, Ohio, videos show state troopers clashing with protesters gathering on campus on Thursday night. The police ordered protesters to vacate, and those who refused to leave were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, said university spokesperson Benjamin Johnson, citing rules prohibiting overnight events.

Students for Justice in Palestine at Ohio State University, a student-led group, had warned protesters of the risk of arrest on Thursday in a demonstration that gathered hundreds of students. The university’s student-run newspaper, the Lantern, reported that about 30 protesters were arrested overnight.

“Shame on you OSU, you will not silence us,” state representative Munira Yasin Abdullahi said in an Instagram post.

Police with shields approached the crowd of about 250 at about 10pm on Thursday. Students were forming a protective circle around the encampment before officials took the protesters to the arrest vans, according to the Lantern. The crowd continued to wave flags and chant “let them pray”.

On Tuesday, two Ohio State students had been arrested in a separate on-campus protest. One of the protesters arrested was unaffiliated with the university, according to the Columbus Dispatch.
Meanwhile, police forcibly cleared a tent encampment at Emerson College, in Boston, with officers arresting 108 people, according to the Berkeley Beacon student newspaper. Videos showed police beating protesters and dragging students to the ground.

The number of campus protest encampments have grown to more than 40 across the nation, NBC’s Today reported on Friday morning.

Emerson College assembled an encampment on Sunday to express support for the student arrests at Columbia University, the campus at the center of the student-led protests, and demand a ceasefire in Gaza.

Protesters were arrested for disturbing the peace, according to the Berkeley Beacon, and it is not currently confirmed how many of the 108 arrested were students at Emerson College.

Ohio State and Emerson were just some of the college campuses with arrests on Thursday amid a wave of protests in solidarity for Palestine, following the example of Columbia University, in New York City, where protesters started pitching protest tents in the middle of campus last week. Uproar ensued from both pro-demonstration and anti-demonstration voices after the university president called in the New York police department to clear the camp, leading to arrests and a fresh encampment springing up.

Encampments in solidarity with Columbia have since emerged at Northwestern University in Cook county, Illinois; Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; George Washington University in Washington DC; Princeton University in New Jersey; the City College of New York ; and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Students at Morehouse College in Georgia were also taken into custody on Thursday, and there were violent clashes and arrests on Wednesday at the University of Southern California and the University of Texas at Austin.

The University of Southern California canceled its main commencement ceremony, a blow to students who began their degrees in the long isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, and marches and protest camps have also occurred at UC Berkeley and Cal Poly Humboldt in northern California.

Tensions also rose at the University of California, Los Angeles, where pro-Israel counterprotesters and pro-Palestinian groups shouted at one another at the school’s encampment.",Columbia University calls for inquiry into leadership as student protests sweep 40 campuses,The Guardian (London),"April 26, 2024 Friday 4:39 PM GMT",0.62213415,0.35846433,0.019401472,palestine_guardian1
